# Dependencies
GitHub Project Relationships and NPM Dependencies

# How to get the NPM advisory data
 - Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 - Open up a terminal or command prompt and navigate to `/Dependencies/`
 - run `npm install nsp` then `nsp gather`

# Getting development environment up and running
- Install [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or setup [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (Preferred)
- Python:
  - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to `/Dependencies/`
  - [Create a python virtualenv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtualenv/)
  - Activate the virtual environment and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Anaconda:
  - Open a terminal or Anaconda Prompt and navigate to `/Dependencies/`
  - Create an Anaconda env with `conda env create -f dependencies.yml`

# Patching ```advisory.json``` with version information
- Open a terminal, command prompt, or Anaconda prompt
- Run `python patch_advisories.py advisories.json`
  - This step will take a while, npmjs.com rate limits connections to ~100 requests every so often
  - It should be able to overcome the rate limit, but it is possible that the script will need to be rerun
  - If it needs to be rerun then copy/rename `patched_advisories.json` to `advisories.json` and then rerun it

# New goal -- predict which Javascript front end framework will take over
## Background
Choosing from amongst even the most popular JavaScript frameworks for a new project can be a challenging process. There seems to be a new handful gaining popularity every year or so, and the previous ones donâ€™t seem to lose steam either! It's very interesting to predict which framework will take over the market in future.

Here is a couple of popular and competitive frameworks:
  - React.js (created and maintained by Facebook)
  - Angular.js (supported by Google)
  - Ember.js (opinionated best practices, rapidly getting your application into production)
  - Backbone.js (old, mature, solid community resource and support)
  - More?

## Objective
**predict popularity of frameworks in future**  
sub-objectives:
  1. collect framework related resources (time information must be included):
    - identify projects that uses these frameworks, collect commits & authors of these projects
    - collect package dependencies and dependents of each framework
    - collect related questions and answers of each framework on StackOverflow
    - retrieve issues and responses of each framework
    - downloads of each framework
  2. calculate predictors based on collected data and train a model (choice model) to make predictions
  3. build a website to show our collected data, result of model, spread trend of each framework, etc.
