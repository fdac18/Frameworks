modelclasswithoutparseextend parse function mycollectionclass backbonecollectionextend model modelclasswithoutparse first problem nt need second problem workaround found examining solution proposed pmalouin builds upon prior proposal responsibility modelparse method determine whether called take action determining called error suggests determination made checking modelcollection first blush suggestion seems make sense since model instance autoinstantiated collection always modelcollection set manually instantiated singleton doubt segregation effortlessly guaranteed inability guarantee segregation also works workaround technique examining modelcollection assumes static structure tells us dynamic usage maybe strongly typed language could case doubt backbone allows manually instantiate model add collection kills workaround yet pmalouin backbone also allows model already within collection used outside collection suppose take individual model send server update singleton nt server send back something would subject parse appropriate parse would singleton collection read backbone code clear model instance member one collection therefore follow model instance member collection also used different context considered singleton whole discussion seems silly view following two points clear parsing twice nobody intention bug simple solution exists solution breaks nothing simple solution requires follow pattern much backbone code create scoped therefore temporary version options object scoped options used turn downstream parse collectionparse completed big deal alexander could easily extend backbonecollection extend collections actually root view model collection objects classes javascript nt classes use start projects custom setters amp constructors handle parents kinds automagical things makes life much easier would nice backbone everyone needs need solutions like one propose could break people code people using parse implemented today suggest trying root collection find something really works well make branch rewrite code tests broken make pullrequest solution see everyone thinks javascript nt classes taking linguistic shortcut easier say class function name starts capital letter intended constructor members added prototype etc find difficult describe thinking without allowing luxury using word class way luckily makes word class official could break people code yes concede could limited imagination come one case would really really weird first common use cases nt get broken server sends singleton json object wrapper collection array objects case parse function needed either level server sends singleton wrapper one member named data json object server sends collection wrapper one member named data array json objects case need one parse function model extract object different parse function collection extract array objects array data longer wrapped fully cooked nothing raw perfectly ordinary case gets broken use case would get broken proposed fix server sends collection something holds array wrapped objects individual items array ie rows wrapper must removed modelparse function use case seems really weird unlikely anyone come scenario server would want go trouble wrapping row items rows nt get success codes queries mean returning collection server reason embellish individual items wrapper would programmer created

additionally jashkenas expressed believed router used chatted bbconf months ago every popular javascript libraryframework moved away pattern place style routing pioneered ember become de facto way

library lol think looking inspiration coming minimal version sort routing system would tremendously improve backbone think could done pretty small amount code providing right hooks would make easier third party developers create emberstyle router backbone third party library quite challenge right end post gathered important characteristics routers routes states router state machine transitions states asynchronous state optionally encoded url transitioned states children states large part complexity emberstyle routing comes routes minimum two callbacks associated asynchronous callback synchronous callback route activated every time url changes history readwrite interface browser history roles faq points two hooks generally two things want url changes fetch data maybe render view also maybe time generally fetching data asynchronous showing html synchronous two hooks routerjs breaks async method three async methods cover variety use cases complexity covers important use cases transitions might outofscope bb cover cases cool part single hook could split hooks plugin authors nested routes nesting routes makes easy compose nested view states also aids preserving view data state imagine route called uri route also imagine two child routes uri uri user active user navigates would nt want refetch data already got also probably would need render view one edge case router solves noted nested states likely far complicated backbone include flat route structure would keep code small right hooks would allow someone rewrite routes transition state machine well come representing many applications states router transitions truly simplify things much added bonus router also used manage state apps nt persist state url like embedded widgets whatevs since encoding state url optional ca nt create current router difficult right two main reasons current router developed different use case mind makes hooks provides bad purpose roles history router conflated think put another way backbone router characteristic emberstyle routing recent changes method attempt resolving first problem sort band aid solutions fundamental problem examples roles history think include url match algorithm history loadurl route execution history loadurl would argue router manage things easilyoverridable separate hooks willing put together poc router interest something like backbone examples roles history think include url match algorithm history loadurl route execution history loadurl would argue router manage things easilyoverridable separate hooks completely agree would much rather event system alerting changes url router holding onto routes detecting match would also help allowing router trigger errors etc generally fetching data asynchronous showing html synchronous two hooks could nt async model stuff synchronous callback way often rerendering route already data need two callbacks seems like overkill backbone nt need handling fetching used ember router found massively overengineered nt think need go ahem route added bonus router also used manage state apps nt persist state url like embedded widgets whatevs url pretty poor way encode app state much better serialize cookie localstorage server depending use case backbone nt need handle think nested routes another area things get dicey pretty quickly agree common pattern nest resources general nt want go one two levels deep sure need business wiring connections disparate parts app given complications seems best book route handles pretty handily already optional syntax agree history probably nt responsible handling route callbacks fall router implement history stateless dumb router significantly decoupled rest backbone originally backbone nt even include router could probably try test plugin first even think replacing already really like see history would look nt manage callbacks could nt async model stuff synchronous callback way often rerendering route already data need two callbacks seems like overkill backbone nt need handling fetching right backbone nt need two callbacks need handle fetching think exposing callback router calls rather inlining would take make far easier another dev make plugin implements rest complexity used ember router found massively overengineered nt think need go ahem route oh yeah sure question emberstyle routing covers lot ground given far complex backbone may late change original post rewrote would emphasize detangling current router easier create different router top rather pointing style router want build top p url pretty poor way encode app state much better serialize cookie localstorage server depending use case backbone nt need handle nt really know mean url string represents state application whether good idea router interprets string configures application corresponding state think nested routes another area things get dicey pretty quickly intended include information nested states fully describe emberstyle router know backbone would never implement smile thinking back prob nt need go much detail pretty late wrote issue sleeping general nt want go one two levels deep tangent think want go deep necessary make application current url four levels using emberstyle router get hang emberstyle routing actually even hard set reason test could probably try test plugin first even think replacing already really like see history would look nt manage callbacks work give update got one url pretty poor way encode app state much better serialize cookie localstorage server depending use case backbone nt need handle interested kind app state mean struggling find single web app nt encode app inside url looking examples backbone site every single one works way mean state individual page part devs tend encode query params anything important enough query params gets discarded nt much time brief alternative approaches great router plugin replaces backbonerouter fine idea go see like think overengineered routers terrible waste time sweat tears using overengineered router organizing app along lines urls brief string serialization application state paradoxically less rich htmly app better works richer featureful app worse state fits nice urls useless router organizing principle using router organize state transitions inside app fundamentally assbackwards already app state real js objects disposal serializing string state deserializing reinflating silly business worrying refetching data already access part idea backbone router drop url breadcrumb whenever application reaches state user might want bookmark go back button nothing think right model minimalist library interested kind app state mean struggling find single web app nt encode app inside url location sure state nope url entry point application guaranteed point resource nt particularly good storing state widgets things nt urls nt storing state router jashkenas said already real js environment work current url repository resource name identifier issues resource route looks like repoissues issueid also happens slash work give update got one awesome looking forward already app state real js objects disposal serializing string state

yes would likely use localstorage accomplish nt see two things incompatible conversation router philosophy really interesting love continue maybe belongs elsewhere rather issue focus concrete changes router agree go backbone agree think backbone router pretty lightweight backbone router history extensible backbone router history currently implemented way makes easily extensible three things currently plan investigate changing expose callback executed whenever route matched rather defining inline scope expose route sorting algorithm separate method modify history solely readwrite interface browser url move features router sidenote jmeas link code sure link tag revision line numbers master shift time make links harder follow future sidenote jmeas link code sure link tag revision line numbers master shift time make links harder follow future good call always forget update links updated three things currently plan investigate changing expose callback executed whenever route matched rather defining inline scope expose route sorting algorithm separate method modify history solely readwrite interface browser url move features router define either inline regular vanilla instance method router preferable nt know exposing would mean changing router ordering algorithm seems like opposite minimal router ordering one predictable order easy change order define routes changing balance code history router totally style question could nice refactor historical reason split history must logically singleton object whereas reason routers need object define either inline regular vanilla instance method router preferable nt know exposing would mean ah sorry callback one tried include link whenever used inline posts may used term without accompanying link somewhere might like dumb nt need really follows naturally number list refactor makes reason use inscope variables callback separate method router makes easier test isolation crazy people like gives hook override explicit talking difference always ask inline ask wait check refactor first changing router ordering algorithm seems like opposite minimal router ordering one predictable order easy change order define routes know feel way people disagree whether disagree sort algorithm currently tied definition handler callback makes tough anything router without overriding code many many developers would appreciate method exposed separately nt want well ca nt stop ya mind wanders angular ember think libraries make incredibly difficult change features though one main reasons devs know use backbone customizable ask wait refactor forming strong opinion expose changing balance code history router totally style question hm interesting think analogous saying changing balance given view given model style question sure may get result one seems philosophically sound think much elegant history interface browser history api nt concern routers said succinctly think history stateless dumb jashkenas preview going soon make clearer hope possible evaluate refactor without thinking turning backbone router ember router think cleanup valuable even one intends use backbone router exact way today sure thing happy wait see sounds like talking individual view state rather application state work app entirely widgetcard based approach works really well thejameskyle distinction two types

may eventually standardized info esdiscuss thread standard still worked experimental support version available babel unfortunately version defines class properties instantiated superclass constructor

decorator applied class prior class constructor executed declarative version saying class documentrow extends backboneview extend documentrowprototype tagname li classname documentrow events click icon open click buttonedit openeditdialog click buttondelete destroy actually nt tested could probably make entire backbone extend function decorator wanted static prototype props unfortunately proposal babel supports behind experimental flag people feeling adventurous possible solution benmccormick decorator technique works well proposal concerns going approach andrewrota literally writing blog post following stuff right reading thread commented big nt personally see actually think better described though create nice new interfaces backbone decorators see gist stevenlangbroek got thinking originally preview followup post putting updated permanent link move permanent url early week sometime basic summary thread learned approaches making backbone properties work current classes spec first need considered fully supported pass properties super constructor treat properties methods add properties directly prototype class declared still see limiting expressiveness extent another think problem less solved decorators become official specification decorators options add props decorator takes props top class adds prototype create several special purpose decorators allow expressivefinegrained interface nt think solutions require additional modifications backbone would interesting role backbonedecorator library ifwhen decorators become standardized would love feedback post publish mondaytuesday benmccormick figured decorators evaluated construction happens thanks correction update gist bit also thanks million mention blog post ping twitter publish could use syntax marionette triggers could exposed class decorator like tagname template blog post thinking ca nt use static properties work backbone understand decorators still stage think great upgrade way write backbone apps especially method decorators events hash sort programming style makes prefer gulp grunt stevenlangbroek see discussion static properties syntax currently specced creates local property instance rather adding prototype properties added super constructor run benmccormick post looks good think good job explaining trade offs options point really like special purpose decorators approach seems best approach assuming decorators make spec benmccormick decorator call constructor prototype lt code gt instorstaticvar lt code gt method used place realise would breaking change seems cleaner way imho like pointed properties defined way prototypeshared strings objects ie shared across instances therefore accessed via class right going make work class properties way need class properties

help catch showstopper bugs faster think much ask people constantly run edge versions backbone get bugfixes need derickbailey example since idea behind patch releases fixes needed packages npm bower nt even debate publish package npm bower semver part api contract enter break contract break modules depend break production code depends module question use semver question want good citizens

perspective semver know jashkenas thoughts yes npm assumes packages repository follow semver determines packages compatible doc version must parseable nodesemver bundled npm dependency npm install semver use version numbers lie interpreted semver correct parsing thus breaking contract breaking compatibility people use package versions npm ecosystem matter personal preference matter package interoperability possible force package play nice nt use semver sure nt call loudly boldly top readme users know necessary introduce breaking change code could easily break publish packages package repositories versioning becomes part interoperability contract ignore contract peril users onerous requirement knowing thousands packages go full blown application onerous requirement forcing users tightly lock versions packages handful modules nt follow rules onerous requirement complicates matter keeping bug fixes security patches etc good reasons follow semver package number might get really big terrible reason use semver tracking progress application distant second reason package versions important function version know version work application btw package number would get really big maybe code smell bump major version make breaking change breaking change definition one breaks openclosed principle open extension closed breaking changes good apis follow openclosed principle closely reasonably users keep pace api changes nt break existing code think lesson learned nt use pulling backbone via packagejson interested perspective semver general agree arguments wonder bumping major

solution sufficient happen need name subviews many situations certainly call hash really default way go underscore trivially make hash behave like array wyuenho nice grid point mainly look patterns used projects since noticed everybody handling different way moving subviews template helper see subviews markup view code understand pattern solution generic stuff need view event like subview model

regions organization view reuse rendering collection models sure including section documentation managing subviews best route cases significant complexities average backbone users nt need understand imo solution might able hashed together polished enough included backbone core case would provide lot value case think definitely needs left plugins thanks tgriesser starting thread well typically go

huge difference much going child views render ends issue lot cases leads frustration nt understand would easily solved adding top level render function wrapping child view constructor nt write docs yet wanted hear bit discussion plugin thinking handle good bit confusion really two simple functions though still think something could considered addition backbone directly also looking back thread braddunbar comment leaving unimplemented allows creativity solving hard problems working backbone instead around opinion boilerplate situation nt see needs hard problem b solved creatively plugin differently time needs done creatively nothing forcing implementation think backbone could provide something case ps dgbeck nice stackoverflow link asked year half ago nt immediately obvious view relationships handled getting started answer nt really answer probably brought dgbeck tgriesser thanks glad posting aproach demonstrates us things wrong long agree needs done creatively nothing forcing implementation think backbone could provide something case dom events delegated views initialized rendered loose dom events subviews simply rerender subviews parent rerendered work around detach reattach dom take approach discussed reinitializing views parent rendered loose state data subviews know easy work around dgbeck know mean rerender parent view usually something like course works subviews inherit view superclass implements way communication goes view hierarchy always make sure share collectionmodel simply trigger custom namespaced events shared collectionmodel like interested parties listen events act accordingly sense collectionmodel reverseddom never found need set event chain among views abuse actual dom propagate backbone events agree tgriesser cases

splitting view smaller subviews first find useful name subviews mailbox example mailboxview wants listen event listview wants tell listbox view collapse messages collapse button mailboxview clicked case useful able reference name problem solved easily storing subviews hash fork code one incarnation change fork people want supply keys subviews keys supplied behavior fall back using numbered indexes hash keys second views state information ca nt loose information parent view rerendered seem efficient reinitialize subviews time parent view rerendered ones store state information views instance using example listview might contain state information message selected storing information attribute messages seem appropriate persisted server shared among different users mind kind temporary view state information belongs view layer models second problem harder solve simply maybe could left plugins could find way distill solution backbonesubviews however hash version backbonenested integrated core could rewrite backbonesubviews plugin top thanks repo efforts helping people common issue address two points agree named views good many cases nt need returns view added easily attach subview parent view like opinion feels bit cleaner vs still maintains necessary cleanup needed case since dependent views maintaining state probably would nt want let parent view rerender really use structure provide keep child views siblings let rerender independently nt worry also prefer opposed references subviews two places feel quite right reminiscent redundancy options attached view viewoptions arguably worse object references need cleaned longer used double references longer guarantees subviews garbage collected many cases may big deal seems little moreover cases people may want customize keys used store subviews example second case rendering collection models might want subviews indexed model object way easily find view corresponds particular model limit people options disadvantage using hash opposed array call ideal maybe better way give subview unique index think makes sense solve problem backbonesubviews approach use case least fact could build approach top hashbased nestedview plugin eliminate code seems like testament nestedview versatility mostly ensuring cascaded prevent latent effects leftover event listeners keeping reference subview going chain nt really big issue eventually gets gced parent view dereferenced reference manually overwrittendeleted need reference name probably going keeping around bit anyway probably least view goes away case fine finding one would nt difficult array either thought needing reference name thinking need first place views theory maintaining state independently nt need referenced parent views often arrays faster yep allowing lookups cids sufficient need provide explicit name push nestableview please take look design rationale readme source code comments mailboxview wants listen event listview wants tell listbox view collapse messages collapse button mailboxview clicked dgbeck entirely possible views example listen mailboxviewmodelmessages events communicate sending listening events shared collectionmodel find views start binding events directly exactly inflexible tightly coupled spagetti code evident need reorder view hierarchy sudden dismantle entire event chain data model rarely change dramatically may extra field maybe extra events add lines andor sprinkle views listen new events large views lot likely change data model insert remove reorder view hierarchy data need given problem always going second views state information ca nt loose information parent view rerendered seem efficient reinitialize subviews time parent view rerendered ones store state information views store state info views time keep methods idempotent rerendering given view state result exact look behavior reintializing subviews necessary keep method idempotent also use template instead deeply nested views desirable nothing tgriesser implementation mine prevents happening jashkenas bit discussion sounds like definitely real world issue faces lot folks building rich ui plenty good cases want view listen object bit longer lived hell advertised global event bus views may subscribe need explicitly removed issue nt much gc preventing latent effects zombie event listeners inturn helps gc pointed maintain references subviews backbone core suddenly lots folks previously nt problems working gc properly start manually removing every subview feature regression possible initial step possibly wrong path beginners think truth quite opposite beginners nt realize need keep track views listen objects outside life cycle see long removing every subview goes chain top level view removal nt manual removal also would optin feature view modelscollections live die together nothing forcing use method using minimal overhead line compared dom manipulation go humble opinion would nt complex addition would quite helpful explaining might need well providing minimal way go think would well received addition great finding model cid would nt difficult array either yes easy hash trading lookups n lookups quickly erase performance edge arrays hashes interesting stack overflow thought needing reference name thinking need first place views theory maintaining state independently nt need referenced parent views often damn world would follow theories also think mistaken beginning thread saying array appropriate view data structure case rendering collection models even backbonecollectionview uses backbonebabysitter internally manage views views stored hash order determined model collection sufficient speak experience seen lots different approaches issue wyuenho thanks sharing plugin integrated core arraybased implementation would end working around top implemented hash could use case splitting one view fixed number subviews might also able use case rendering collection clean small seems like solid foundation majority cases summary far necessary removing subviews automatically inside good idea tbd support adding removing list views provide minimal boilerplate render subviews parent view like nestableview use hash array combination hashes arrays internal storage provide help facilitate view communication via events subviews get reference parent views related provide way lookup views indexkeycid preferences yes leaning yes unless choice internal storage adt makes slow yes people nt care subviews continue override continue work people choose override something else like implementation hash fast lookups lookups key possibly view need way retain insertion order encourage sharing collectionmodel within view hierarchy use custom namespaced events triggered collectionmodel seems easiest without using extra plugins trying coerce dom propagate backbone events nt found necessary experience causes trouble worth left users maybe minimum document various ways set crossview communication preference point really depends choice data structure thoughts hi quite long thread nt able read sorry nevertheless wanted give two cents mater project work made implementation solve problem call fatherview implementation shares lot aspects things said key points child views stored plain object child views named explicit name defined calling equivalent add view name already exists old view removed helps lot implement simple idempotent renders adding getting views done via method called works like jquery propattr pass one argument works getter pass two works setter instantiation left implementations view keeps track references cleans necessary method called remove child views called saying best correct way objective explain use case maybe feedback approach improved addsubview removesubview necessary nt think deemed necessary yet definitely possible get along without everyone bit different take something think could helpful building robust modelcollection structures bootstrapping nested modelscollections grabbingdumping individual modelsviews times things change lfacpt thanks sharing sounds bit closer something opinionated like layout manager swapping views etc sounds like shares similar features approaches mentioned namely parent stores child views ability remove one way another necessary casual single view usage necessary move discussion forward seriously look like trying reimplement backbonelayoutmanager tho well say reason opted fatherview instead backbonelayoutmanager something similar locs little abstraction easy understand yet allows us keep code clean simple one reasons use backbone abstractions simple easy understand yet powerful imho plugin nested views also follow philosophy ok actually jsdoc requirejs boilerplate almost p think tgriesser nailed beginning nt think better terms utility per character think hash better choice grounds ease use performance versatility wyuenho idea using hash keys perfect default guaranteeing unique keys people could also option supply keys lookup subviews name whatever works best case tim original code hash tweak gets vote best candidate core integration still partial solution least use cases solid building block sophisticated solutions presented thread could built top undershooting rather overshooting seems fit well rest backbone relatively small amount code provides lot helpful structure suggest use view instead subview terminology talking nested views think sub prefix introduces unneeded verbosity andreypopp action names add remove could also argued naming seems important backbone could good examples remember reading somewhere around jashkenas explaining logic adding could also use nt know dgbeck fact js hash nt retain insertion order really concerns ordering subview matter lots application lots applications ca nt guarantee irrelevance subview ordering using hash adt storage insufficient least backgridjs would really really prefer store subviews array preserve insertion order hash fast lookups necessary acstll agree probably succinct names else adding call acstll agree add remove probably succinct names else adding call view add could easily confused adding objects models data points chart nonview dom elements etc nt forget views used sorts creative ways right philfreo could argue collection methods never existed would confused still anything want change collection specifically meant hold models subview management per se pointing view add nt completely obvious without possibility confusion due fact primary purpose view nt hold views see fine either way actually pointing view add nt completely obvious without possibility confusion due fact primary purpose view nt hold views wyuenho philfreo exactly also adding could lead beginners think rendering even dom case keeping reference hash wanted point nothing else wyuenho acstll philfreo asked dropping suffix ok instead wyuenho bummer order need keep views splitting view fixed number subviews rendering collection dgbeck wyuenho think need use cases see take issue view subclass subviews stored hash collectionview subclasses backboneviewxview also stores subviews array dgbeck wyuenho collectionview scope discussion examples provide proof view subviews stored hash suitable building block abstractions like collectionview asked dropping sub suffix ok addview removeview instead addsubview removesubview agree fine addressing philfreo point may provide sufficient information exactly adding redundant adding view view new view implicitly subview andreypopp dgbeck sure talking collectionview scope discussion mainly use subviews render collection elements nt many occasions split large views smaller views suppose could happen quite often also biased second example backgrid could easily built using top level view still would nt keep components inside hash attach filter grid paginator inside instance vars set inside constructor suppose keeping inside hash explicit name minimize name collisions however unlikely maybe heh feel like backtracking previous position using hash backing store split large view subviews name subcomponents using instance vars convey purposes think choice data structure really comes would want render subviews case splitting view dgbeck termed would use term heterogeneous subviews hash convenient want able get individually render attach well defined points inside template sufficiently smart solution willcan keep ids template names subviews loop hash case rendering collection homogeneous subviews array natural easily loop append rendered subviews names nt important individually subview case collectively collection subviews may need named class list class classify subview use cases way seem like mutually exclusive circumstances would require actually homogeneous subview case hash would also fine keep ordering keys would model cids inside collection attached parent would nice default render implementation render cases automatically people still override even flexible implementation course make use nested models well whole story agree wyuenho earlier point storing subviews array hash would desirable worked several projects maintaining order subviews vital hash alone would nt work mostly subsections need processed particular order chaplin take overload

silent set yes definitely thanks tim ugh whole concept silent true gone disappointing imagine index view collection imagine user something ui bulk operation models collection performance reasons seems perfectly reasonable desireable able iterate collection update model new attribute silent option even shortcircuiting described event gets triggered every single model every single listener potentially significant performance drawback well development problem every developer needs update every single event handler check silent flag code exactly described iteration fire custom event says

complicate code much could understand maybe dreading next upgrade thanks response btw performance drawbacks shenanigans going change far costly triggering events bit moot point imagine listening

conclusion great functionality plugin extend backbone net benefits end negligible apps less typing really real benefit letting reference cached selectors cache eg agree wookiehangover let leave plugins extensions agree reasoning see clean another issue views may attached existing dom elements ui hash would need filled initialize whereas cases would need filled render appreciate clean backbone important keep way aware jquery caching however counter point although people could create hash whenever appropriate render initialize reality people new backbone end retyping selectors time want reference element sure agree bad practice work backbone might change something like code provided however elegance structure declaring dom elements property view lacking moreover still repeating selectors due events hash javascript events click input namevalue valuefldonclick render function thisui valuefld input namevalue another approach record solves redundancy issue perhaps little cleaner first approach selectors property could map element names jquery selectors names could used place selectors events hash separate property example selectors function evaluates selectors fly since jquery apparently caches us consideration dom changes return appropriate jquery object javascript selectors valuefld input namevalue events click valuefld valuefldonclick render function selectors valuefld focus shorten use els instead selectors seems like common access dom elements inside view keystroke significant principle advantages see less typing eliminate redundancy issue jquery selectors added structure help newbies avoid bad practices conversation interesting leads believe developers making small enough views many cases find writing code like javascript events click button doaction doaction function ev var formdata form serialize little selector lookup since everything scoped view get away easily looking button totally see situational though definitely cases repeated actions single jquery object like jquery past taught cache locally javascript doaction function ev var form form formon submit function formattr action something formsubmit anyways mostly commenting saw tutorial recently marionette found rather odd lookups done declaratively way interesting find selector lookup constantly also edited original comment oversights errors selectors evaluated fly avoid problem described wookiehangover selectors would clearly need function curious braddunbar additional thoughts cool see ideas evaluated big thanks helping awesome library considering plugin route drop support ie implement getters way could keep declarative binding object instead function lookupscache transparently main concern trading little typing added complexity wookiehangover says vs see savings typing already fairly short lose bit flexibility feel though hack around often agree tbranyen point many selectors usually though always sign view split eliminating redundancy events hash added structure also significant benefits would say definitely hear added complexity concern though appreciate effort goes keep backbone light weight thanks also future reference appears question weather jquery actually caches selectors dgbeck looks like question sizzle nt introduced core lot improvements since edit looks like sizzle cache length might recent jquery ah cool although looks like sizzle caches compiled selector functions elements makes sense considering dom manipulation could invalidate cache elements taking step back though sure much caching elements impacts real world

splitting source library rather small custom builds save kilobytes best added complexity would significant worth discussed least previously use cases example user using jquery mobile backbonejs want

implementation providing well understood technique requires extra explanation code situation come first place backbone attempted circumvent calling super methods nt think adding methods simplify fact

know new backbone know heck nt even know work create store way even gave random string plus relishing idea giant list stores like seems horribly unnormalized backbonerelational approach seems good also hinges setting url parameter meant return proper models issue faq goes list approaches like mirror sql database structure structure nosql database use models arrays foreign key ids join top level collections ala tables associations numerous use range ids instead explicit list avoid ids use direct references creating partial object graph representing data set lazily load joined models server lazily deserialize nested models json documents sound good sound pretty similar none good examples love see bullet points fleshed guess ideally like something allowed use two stores one projects one

along mix event callbacks exemple error event also called backbonesync fails might lead confusion look sproutcore event loop events triggered async start event loop one first newbie mistake events

function trigger think best help move project actual async events first thanks insight sorry nt read bind trigger code prior commenting quick note turning current triggering async event loop based one tying dom really really bad idea events pattern inversion control necessarily imply asynchronicity use events instead method calls whenever multiple objects notified central object state changes without central object aware observers done avoid models tightlycoupled ui example instead model like business model concerned views may may present page time instead allows model oblivious ui ui

use cases like seems like backbone could benefit set eventscallbacks similar provided rails models would allow model hook part save process would flexible bindtrigger system would also easily allow
