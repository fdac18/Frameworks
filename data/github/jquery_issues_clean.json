    "body": "When comparing two non-equal objects that have the same prototype chain, it seems unnecessary to report all the properties on their prototype chain. This because we can know a priori that the difference between the two objects won't be found in their prototype object.\r\nThis behavior discourages test driven development, as having several failing tests quickly result in insurmountable amounts of lines being logged. Generating all that HTML slows down the browser.\r\n\r\nThis issue has two legs:\r\na. Should the `Diff`-section log all prototypal properties when we know that the difference between the objects can't reside among the prototypal properties?\r\nb. Should qUnit log all prototypal properties when logging an object?\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n`a.deepEqual( new THREE.Vector3(1,2,3), new THREE.Vector3(2,3,4), \"Bare bone test of excessive logging of

But, once you have moved the ball (it is a draggable element), and pass the mouse over the ball when the ball is moved, the event will be triggered again.\r\n\r\nThe desirable steps are:\r\n- Move the ball to a wherever position and trigger the ``moving...`` text\r\n- Once the mouse has been released (ie, the ball is placed where I want) the ``moving...`` text must not be triggered again unless I clicked the ball. [Note that what's going on, is that, this step is failing]. Refer to the console and you will see that ``moving`` text is printed when the ball is placed once it has been moved.\r\n\r\nI hope everything is clear,\r\nLet me know if you have problems to understand my issue,\r\n\r\nTom\u00e1s."

However, we do this for all elements whether the boolean attribute is valid on that element or not. This is especially troublesome for custom elements.\r\n\r\nRather than checking the nodeName of the element to ensure the boolean attribute applies to that element, it may be doable to just allow any string through. It may not be technically valid, but I think it works in all browsers to set any string. We'd still want to keep the special handling for the value `false` (i.e. remove the attribute rather than set `\"false\"`, which is actually `true`). Note that the string `\"false\"` would still be passed through.\r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/16602#issuecomment-397794145 for background."

First cell in each row has a different width (200px, 190px, 180px), top row overrides width of cells in the \r\nWhen width specified in style attribute matches content width of the element - the value returned by `.outerWidth()` is different.\r\n\r\nRunning the test case on IE (in console) produces 200, 190, 200 while on Chrome the result is 200, 200, 200.\r\n\r\nThis is messes with my `dataTables` and `fixedColumn.dataTables` components that rely on `.css('width')` and hence `.outerWidth()`.\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be in `getWidthOrHeight` function (jQuery v3.3.1). Specifically this line (6368):\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t// Check for style in case a browser which returns unreliable values\r\n\t// for getComputedStyle silently falls back to the reliable elem.style\r\n\tvalueIsBorderBox = valueIsBorderBox &&\r\n\t\t( support.boxSizingReliable() || val === elem.style[ dimension ] );\r\n```\r\n\r\n`val` is coming from `window.getComputedStyle().width` but `elem.style['width']` is coming from `style` attribute (as I understand it). And when these two values are equal it leads jQuery to believe that `val` is a `border` box size already and doesn't add padding.\r\n\r\nChanging the width of the second row cell to `191px` or `189px` results in `outerWidth()` of the problematic cell (`th`) to `200`.\r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\nhttps://codepen.io/rgavrilov/pen/KeqxJp\r\n\r\nI expect all 3 values printed to codepen's console to be the same, but they differ on IE, even though all 3 TH cells (of the first column) are of the same width."

It's a very important feature.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, even if the browser ALLOWS external domains access to iframes/windows in different domains for some weird reason JQUERY 3.x shows an error when trying to access these iframes/windows. JQUERY 1.12.4 didnt have have this problem.\r\n\r\nYou can check this bug very easily: \r\n\r\n1) first close all chromes windows/instances on your computer and then relaunch it using the disable-web-security flag, something like the code below:\r\n\r\nstart \"Chrome\" \"chrome.exe\" --disable-web-security \r\n\r\n2) after that acess this jsfiddle -> http://jsfiddle.net/36sewf1p/1/   -> this fiddle will simply open a window (with an external domain) and after 5 seconds will try to access its content.\r\n\r\n3) check your browser console (in the jsfiddle tab) and you will see this error:\r\n\r\nBlocked a frame with origin \"http://fiddle.jshell.net\" from accessing a cross-origin frame.\r\n    at http://fiddle.jshell.net/_display/:34:24\r\n"

    "body": "### Description ###\r\nRequesting for a \"render\" function on elements.\r\nFrom time to time I run into a situation where I need to apply several changes to a DOM element but I need the browser to render the first change before applying the next.\r\nFor this I add a render function to jQuery like this:\r\n\r\n`jQuery.fn.extend({\r\n  render: function() {\r\n    this[0].offsetHeight\r\n    return this;\r\n  }\r\n});`\r\n\r\nThen I can use it like this:\r\n_$(\"#progressIndicator\")\r\n    .css({ transition: \"width 0s\", width: \"0%\" })\r\n    .render()\r\n    .css({ transition: \"\" });_\r\n\r\nIn this example, it disables the CSS transition animation while resetting the progressBar and when done, it re-enabled the transition for the next change.\r\n\r\nCalling an element's offsetHeight forces the browser to render the changes and execute the rest of the code after rendering. Adding the render function allows for easy chaining.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking it would be beneficial for others to add this render function by default. I notices that there are many questions asked and articles written to get around the issue of rendering changes which could all be solved easily this way.\r\nThanks\r\n"

However, I've prepared a PR with the fix and the test case provided in it is the following:\r\n```js\r\nQUnit.test( \"contents() for <object />\", function( assert ) {\r\n\tassert.expect( 2 );\r\n\r\n\tvar svgObject = jQuery( \"<object id='svg-object' data='\" + baseURL + \"1x1.svg'></object>\" );\r\n\tvar done = assert.async();\r\n\r\n\tsvgObject.on( \"load\", function() {\r\n\t\tvar contents = jQuery( \"#svg-object\" ).contents();\r\n\t\tassert.equal( contents.length, 1, \"Check object contents\" );\r\n\t\tassert.equal( contents.find( \"svg\" ).length, 1, \"Find svg within object\" );\r\n\t\tdone();\r\n\t} );\r\n\r\n\tjQuery( \"#qunit-fixture\" ).append( svgObject );\r\n} );\r\n```\r\n"

I ask mostly because typically the selector statement is the start of a chain:\r\n\r\nThis statement ends up being a no-op when an element with id=elementid doesn't exist (for whatever reason, document not ready, server didnt emit it, etc)\r\n```\r\n$(\"#elementid\").on(\"click\", function(e) { console.log(\"click!\"); });\r\n```\r\n\r\nProblem is, that no-op is subtle, and difficult to log.  You can test for it first, but this breaks the chain\r\n```\r\nif($(\"#elementid\").length==0) {\r\n  console.log('didnt find #elementid');\r\n} else {\r\n  $(\"elementid\").on(\"click\", function(e) { console.log(\"click!\"); });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suppose you could extend jquery, but this particular implementation breaks the chain.\r\n```\r\njQuery.fn.exists = function () {\r\n    return this.length !== 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps switching the implementation allows for chaining, but now requires inserting \"exists\" into all jQuery code:\r\n```\r\njQuery.fn.exists = function () {\r\n   if(this.length == 0) console.warn(\"jQuery warning: selector '%s' found zero items.\", this.selector);\r\n   return this;\r\n}\r\n\r\n$(\"#elementid\").exists().on(\"click\", function(e) { console.log(\"click!\"); });\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Testing ###\r\n1. Start with an empty DOM, \r\n2. `var $result = jQuery(\".definitelyNoClassDefined\")`\r\n3. `assert.that($result.length.is(0))`\r\n3. check that console.log is invoked with \"jQuery warning: Selector '.definitelyNoClassDefined' returns zero items.\"\r\n\r\nI feel like this could easily be plugged into all patch releases since its not a breaking change.\r\n\r\nEDIT: this started with https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49803687/can-jquery-generate-warning-when-a-selector-finds-nothing-when-chaining"

It would be simpler if we used a private value for the interval value (basically just hard-code the default `13`) so that *any* use of `jQuery.fx.interval` could be indentified as deprecated. There is a slight risk that someone might be changing that value but it seems unlikely since we are already ignoring it except for two rare-ish cases: 1) IE9 always, 2) browsers when the document is hidden.\r\n\r\nIn addition, per some discussion on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/pull/298 we may want to change from `document.hidden` to `document.visibilityState` since the standard has changed. From looking at caniuse.com it seems like IE10/IE11 support `rAF`  and `document.hidden` but not  `document.visibilityState` so I am not sure that is possible until we drop their support."

(i.e. not some most common ones like `width`) Deprecating all of that would go towards the ideal goal but might trigger warnings on the vast majority of projects so perhaps it'd be less invasive to not do it on the ones we will auto-fix.\r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\nN/A\r\n"

When a user clicks on whatever the button is, the next question appears. Our approach (@victcebesp and I) was to modify the question and its answer using JQUERY. Both question and answer are within a ``div`` with an ID. The buttons has two classes ``btn btn-primary`` (the ones provided by bootstrap).\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\nWhen a button is clicked, the content changes once!.

You should press `ALT`, then `w`. Don't release `ALT` and keep pressing and releasing `w`. Now, when you want to stop release `ALT` (usually you release `ALT` after releasing `w` or at the same time).\r\n\r\nIt's like doing `ALT` + `TAB` on windows.\r\n\r\nRight now nothing happens, but before upon releasing `ALT` I was able to capture the moment when `ALT` key was released.\r\n\r\nThe only way I can capture the release of `ALT` is if while pressing `w`, I release `ALT` first.\r\n\r\nHere is a fiddle to test: [https://jsfiddle.net/e4berr36/1/](https://jsfiddle.net/e4berr36/1/)"

It appears that no body is treated as an error case since there is no JSON to process, given that the errorThrown is:\r\n\r\n        SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input\r\n            at parse (<anonymous>)\r\n            at Ut (jquery-3.3.1.min.js:2)\r\n            at k (jquery-3.3.1.min.js:2)\r\n            at XMLHttpRequest.<anonymous> (jquery-3.3.1.min.js:2)\r\n\r\nThis also occurs for XML, however perhaps the case should be that no root element is actually valid, and JSON/XML parsing should be held off in such a case.\r\n\r\n* Current workarounds are to return an empty object from the REST API so the success block is hit as expected, or to change the dataType expected to 'text' so no automatic parsing is done and manually handle for when a body is not empty (which if using this pattern, should only be in error situations, and thus handled in the error function).\r\n"

Either the 'unsafe-inline' keyword, a hash ('sha256-oKrRnv4NSECe1z+2Q8HSC47J9uP6ALT0+UguOrbK7UU='), or a nonce ('nonce-...') is required to enable inline execution.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand if you click on the `Load script via script tag` button then the script is loaded without issues and the text `OK` is shown in the console.\r\n\r\n**Note:** I am reporting this issue, because third-party libraries use `$.getScript()` and they consider this a jQuery issue (rightly) and won't fix this by their own because they expect the fix from jQuery.\r\n\r\nFor example see this issue: https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input/issues/541\r\n\r\n## Security considerations\r\n\r\nUsing constructs which require `unsafe-inline` or `unsafe-eval` are generally not recommended and the security community considers them as bad practice.\r\n\r\n[Mozilla MDN states](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src#Unsafe_inline_script) the following about `unsafe-inline`:\r\n\r\n> Disallowing inline styles and inline scripts is one of the biggest security wins CSP provides.\r\n\r\nGoogle recommends the same in their [Web Fundamentals guide](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/csp/)\r\n\r\n> If you must have inline script and style, you can enable it by adding 'unsafe-inline' as an allowed source in a script-src or style-src directive. You can also use a nonce or a hash (see below), but **you really shouldn't**. **Banning inline script is the biggest security win CSP provides**, and banning inline style likewise hardens your application.\r\n\r\n> you can enable them by adding 'unsafe-eval' as an allowed source in a script-src directive, but **we strongly discourage this**.\r\n\r\nSo I hope you will consider changing the current behavior for the sake of a safer web (taking into account how widespread your library is)."

So this is very often seen out there:\r\n\r\n```JS\r\n$('input').keyup(function() {\r\n    if (event.which == 13) {\r\n        // do something\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy idea was, that it would be really helpful and nicer to write, if there would be an optional parameter on these events, that could be a single integer, or an array of integers, representing the `key codes`, that will be used as filter for the event trigger.\r\n\r\nThe example above could look somehow like this then:\r\n\r\n```JS\r\n$('input').keyup(13, function() {\r\n    // do something\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr an example with more key codes:\r\n\r\n```JS\r\n$('input').keyup(function() {\r\n    if (event.which == 13 || event.which == 27 || event.which == 10) {\r\n        // do something\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n\r\n$('input').keyup([13, 27, 10], function() {\r\n    // do something\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would produce way less code to write, if often used, is easy to understand and would be compatible to the current api, if I'm not wrong."

The exceptions are IE, iOS & Android. Wrt to IE it's obvious we can't switch to the \"`current` & `current-1`\" scheme as this browser is dead and we support it for legacy reasons. Android Browser 4.0-4.3 still has around 6.1% of Android Browser market share (91.8% of which are Android 4.1-4.3) so we can't drop Android Browser just yet.\r\n\r\niOS is different. It doesn't progress as quickly as desktop rolling-release browsers as Safari cannot be updated separately from the OS but people update the OS pretty quickly. Stats show hardly anyone uses an iOS version older than `current-2` at any given moment. [Apple stats](https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/) provide some insight but they don't separate `current-2` from older versions.\r\n\r\nCurrently we explicitly support iOS 7+. This means as long as we don't release a new major jQuery version we have to test on more & more iOS versions (currently 4 of them). Could we limit ourselves to a specific number of iOS versions supported in line with most of the desktop browsers? I feel `current` & `current-1` might be too little but perhaps we can limit ourselves to last 3 stable versions?\r\n\r\nThis would have to happen in jQuery 4.0 & newer as we try to not limit https://jquery.com/browser-support/ in patch/minor releases.\r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\nN/A\r\n"

    "body": "Hi - so I just wanted to take an opportunity to enquire about the future of this library and what the plans are going forward in terms of updates and support. \r\n\r\nOver the last few years it's fair to say the landscape has changed, frameworks including Angular, React and VueJS have introduced a new paradigm for writing JavaScript and in some ways made jQuery redundant - to the effect that it's encouraged not to load/use the library at all. \r\n\r\nThis is also inline with an observable decrease in the number of releases being pushed, with just 3.2 and 3.2.1 this March. Before that, 3.1 shipped in July 2016. And whereas there were 8 blog posts in 2015 and 16, there has just been the one this year, and ever since, silence.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, we've seen a number of major changes in the JavaScript ecosystem, including (and not an exhaustive list): promises, arrow functions, spread operator, async/await, generators, fetch api (replaces ajax), template literals, let/const and classes.\r\n\r\nAll of these changes can add up to one of the biggest rewrites of the library we've seen to date. I question whether Ajax is still required now that Fetch is supported on all major browsers. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWith all that said, my main question is what is the plan going into 2018 and beyond in regards to jQuery; it's no lie with each passing year an already aging codebase, some of which hasn't been touched in years, continues to be common across the web. It'd be delightful to see a v4 project attempted to try and remove any parts which are no longer required and focusing on keeping only the absolute essentials, focusing on extreme performance and a modern codebase now that all these new language features have been added to the browser.\r\n\r\nThank you and I look forward to any comments this issue may generate.\r\n\r\nHappy coding :)"

I had/have an issue with outerHeight calculation on jQuery on just one of these machines. The element height was 36px as set in the CSS, and also showed as being 36px in the element inspector of both chrome instances however jQuery 3.2.1 returns an incorrect outerHeight and outerHeight(true) on one of these machines.  A lot of head scratching and comparing things and I eventually realised the issue was with the latest version of jQuery, possibly with the 3.X branch. In any case, I rolled back to jQuery 2.2.4 and both machines are now reporting the correct value for outerHeight and outerHeight(true).    \r\n\r\nThis seems like a pretty clear regression to me.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I can be of any help\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nJerry"

For example, lets say a library extends the string class and adds the following prototype to the string class in an application:\r\n\r\nString.prototype.hasCharacter = function(char){\r\n        if(!char){\r\n             throw 'char expected';\r\n       }\r\n\tvar idx = this.indexOf(char);\r\n\treturn (idx >= 0);\r\n}\r\n\r\nThey have added some code to verify if the input value is defined and throw and error so that higher up functions can handle it. This is fairly normal and I have seen this behavior in a ton of code over the years.\r\n\r\nIf you then pass a string into the jQuery.param function it will try to run this function without passing in a value using when it processes this line of code:\r\n\r\n`var value = jQuery.isFunction( valueOrFunction ) ? valueOrFunction() : valueOrFunction;`\r\n\r\nI just spent half a day helping someone track down a bug in their app which came to this situation. \r\n\r\nTo make the jQuery.param function more robust I see two possible solutions:\r\n\r\n- Wrap valueOrFunction() with try/catch.\r\n- Later in the code when looping through the prefix values, use a proper for loop instead of a foreach, at least for string values. This would reduce the number of iterations in the loop, thus making it faster, and would also prevent this error from occurring. \r\n\r\nI don't use jQuery that often so I'll leave it to the community to decide the best approach to improve this. \r\n\r\n"

I also find duplicate issues reported bugs like \r\n```\r\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for '' in \u2018\u2019\r\n```\r\nAnd yeah I find out the owner replied, saying it was clear in the document that the type passed in should be array or object. So that was users fault that did not read the document, but it is still unreasonable for you to use the name of `isArrayLike`. \r\n\r\nWould you add a comment to the function or rename this function?\r\n"

The second form, Bar, is submitted by a submit button within the form. Bar also has an event handler on the submit event, this handler will disable the beforeunload confirmation dialog so that Bar can be submitted without asking the user to confirm. When you submit Foo, the confirmation dialog displays and you can choose to stay on the page. The page should remain unaffected as if the button was never pressed. This works fine in pure js, but when using jQuery in IE or Edge choosing to stay on the current page causes the onsubmit handler of Bar to become detached somehow, so it doesn't run when Bar gets submitted. In this case that just means that the user gets another annoying dialog, but it can cause more severe problems if there is some processing that needs to happen in that handler before the form is submitted.\r\n\r\nI've worked around this in my own code by just calling submit on the raw form element.

It seems to add the element's insets (padding + border) to its width and height, although the CSS width already includes the insets.\r\n\r\n### Demonstration ###\r\nhttp://output.jsbin.com/yipudeloya/\r\n\r\nIn the provided test case, we have two \\<div>s with 10px padding on all sides, 1px border on all sides and a CSS width/height set to 32px. Because box-sizing is set to `border-box`, the visual size of the elements is 32x32px with a remaining \"inner\" space of 10px. At 100% browser zoom level, this is correctly reported both by `css('width')` and `.outerWidth()`.\r\n\r\nIf we now zoom to 110%, the numbers get slightly changed, probably due to some rounding errors (31.9886px instead of 32px). Because we should always get \"CSS pixels\" that are not affected by browser zoom, I would have expected those numbers to stay the same - but I can live with that. The real problem occurs when you reload the page while having the browser zoom at 110%! Now the width is completely incorrect (53.977236000000005px instead of 32px).\r\n\r\nIf the page uses those values for programmatic layout, the results will be wrong. You can see the effect in the demo. The CSS width and height of the first \\<div> are copied to the second, so they should always be the same size. However, if you start at 100%, the second \\<div> is much larger.\r\n\r\n### Analysis ###\r\nAnalysis has shown that this seems to be caused by the internal function `computeStyleTests()` in *css/support.js* that wrongly sets the internal property `boxSizingReliableVal` to `false`. Apparently, this happens because of a rounding error. In my case, the test div's measured width is 3.997px, which is not equal to the expected value of 4px. What's worse, this internal property is only calculated once! So when you start at 110% zoom, and then reset it to 100%, the problem still persists until you completely reload the page.\r\n\r\nI could observe the problem at the following zoom levels: 110%, 90%, 80%, 67% and 33%.\r\n\r\nFirefox (v56) and IE (v11) don't seem to be affected by this problem. Also, with jQuery 2.1.4, everything works fine on all browsers. All tests were performed on Windows 7 with default DPI and font size settings.\r\n"

The latter in turn causes the `text script` converter to be used to parse the response from the server, which would throw an error.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, this is caused by the `ajaxPrefilter` for the `json jsonp` datatype, where `rjsonp = /(=)\\?(?=&|$)|\\?\\?/;` is used to test the request data, which would match any string that contains `??`. \r\n\r\nCurrently I worked around the issue by explicitly setting `jsonp` to `false`, but I couldn't think of why this should be the case. \r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\n```\r\n// OK\r\n$.ajax({\r\n  url: 'https://httpbin.org/post',\r\n  type: \"POST\",\r\n  dataType: 'json',\r\n  data: JSON.stringify({foo: 'bar'})\r\n}).done(function(r){\r\n  console.log(r);\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Not OK\r\n$.ajax({\r\n  url: 'https://httpbin.org/post',\r\n  type: \"POST\",\r\n  dataType: 'json',\r\n  data: JSON.stringify({foo: 'bar??'})\r\n}).done(function(r){\r\n  console.log(r);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n"

    "body": "  ### What do you expect to happen?\r\nWhen calling `.css('key', 'val !important')`, the correct css is added to the element.\r\n\r\n  ### What actually happens?\r\njQuery silently ignores the css value. This can be tested by performing the following:\r\n\r\n    $('body').css('background', 'hotpink !important');\r\n\r\n#### Using jQuery 3.2.1, but I can see this issue has [been around for a while](https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11173).\r\n\r\nWhether or not this should be added to jQuery is another matter for debate, but I think regardless, the parser should return an error, or at least information, if it has failed to parse CSS that has been passed to it. I've just wasted half an hour on a project trying to figure out why my CSS wasn't being added to a dynamically created element, and didn't stop to think that jQuery might just be ignoring the `!important` part.\r\n"

    "body": "### Description ###\r\n\r\nThe way a chained promise is resolved in jQuery 3 seems to have changed compared to how it was in jQuery 1.x and 2.x. This does not appear to be related to the async behaviour change, which is well documented.\r\n\r\nI have not yet been able to fully pinpoint the problem, but the end result is that jQuery is not consistently resolving a promise with the resolution value. Instead, if the resolution value is itself a promise, it can decide to hide this promise from the caller and instead waits for it directly.\r\n\r\nThis is undesirable as not all promise chains are a single continuous actions. Having a handler in between the different actions is mandatory and expected.\r\n\r\nAt Wikimedia, the \"OOjs UI\" library has an interface for confirmation dialogs. It works like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nOO.ui.confirm( /* string */ text ).then( function ( /* boolean */ result ) {\r\n /* .. */\r\n} );\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe returned promise resolves with a boolean value true/false depending on which button the user pressed.\r\n\r\nInternally this method uses a promise to create a dialog, wait for its opening animation, and wait for its closing/cleanup actions.\r\n\r\nSource code: <https://github.com/wikimedia/oojs-ui/blob/v0.21.1/src/windows.js#L52-L85>\r\n```js\r\nOO.ui.confirm = function ( text, options ) {\r\n\treturn OO.ui.getWindowManager().openWindow( 'message', $.extend( {\r\n\t\tmessage: text\r\n\t}, options ) ).then( function ( opened ) {\r\n\t\treturn opened.then( function ( closing ) {\r\n\t\t\treturn closing.then( function ( data ) {\r\n\t\t\t\treturn $.Deferred().resolve( !!( data && data.action === 'accept' ) );\r\n\t\t\t} );\r\n\t\t} );\r\n\t} );\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nMost promises return a primitive value or an object with methods that can be called to yield another promise. However in this case, the promise is actually resolved with another promise. The resolution indicates that the opening is done (`opening.then`) and the value given is the promise that will be resolved once the dialog is closed. The latter is malfunctioning in jQuery 3.\r\n\r\nIt appears it is internally unwrapping this promise layer, thus causing a mismatch between the actual and expected value. Instead of `openWindow().then()` being given the Thenable \"opened\", it is given the final `data` value (which is not a promise). Thus causing this exception whenever `OO.ui.confirm()` is called:\r\n\r\n> **jQuery.Deferred exception: opened.then is not a function**\r\n\r\nDownstream bug report: <https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T163510>\r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\n\r\nMinimal test case at: <https://codepen.io/Krinkle/pen/JNbNzg?editors=0010>\r\n\r\nCompare jQuery 1.11.3, 1.12.4, 2.2.4 and 3.2.1 - with only the latter failing.\r\n\r\nProblems highlighted in red:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"619\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-04-25 at 13 02 52\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/156867/25405233/827824bc-29b7-11e7-9234-265273412171.png\">\r\n\r\nI'm not a 100% sure whether this was meant to be supported in the past. At first it might seem sketchy indeed. I'd be willing to workaround it as long as we make sure that this change is well-documented and that the suggested alternative way to do this works both in jQuery 1.x and jQuery 3.x."

    "body": "I am using jQuery 1.12.4 and compared the AJAX code to the latest, 3.2.1, and it is pretty much the same thing so I would imagine the problem still exists in the latest version.\r\n\r\nI am using SeaMonkey and Firefox, but my customers may be using Firefox, IE, Chrome, you name it... I also tested the same problems on IE and Android (\"Internet\" [a Safari clone], Chrome, Firefox) and no luck on my end. Once in a while, though, the customers get an AJAX error, which comes out as `\"no error\"` (at least, no error messages whatsoever, `status` is `0` and the `statusText` is `\"\"`.) So far, I have not been able to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nI am wondering whether the following snippet (from 1.12.4) could be the culprit. As we can see, the transport object will actually send the request. If that fails and the low level JavaScript implementation of XHR throws, could it be throwing an [`Error()` object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error)?\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n      state = 1;\r\n      transport.send( requestHeaders, done );\r\n    } catch ( e ) {\r\n      if ( state < 2 ) {\r\n        // Propagate exception as error if not done\r\n        done( -1, e );\r\n      } else {\r\n        // Simply rethrow otherwise\r\n        throw e;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAs we can see, you call `done( -1, e );` and _if_ `e` is an `Error()` object, it may be better to use:\r\n\r\n    done( -1, e.message );\r\n\r\nWe also have access to a `fileName` and `lineNumber` or the `toString()` function, which may format the message according to the browser in use including even more information.\r\n\r\n    done( -1, e.toString() );\r\n\r\nThe `done()` second parameter is expected to be a string and not an `Error()` object.\r\n\r\nNote that since I cannot currently reproduce the problem on my own systems, I do not know whether this is required or not. Often, an object `toString()` function is automatically called when you do something such as `e + \"\"` (which happens in the `done()` function.)\r\n\r\nOne of the affected browsers is Chrome on iPhone, although I'm not totally sure that the browser is the culprit in itself. That is, in most cases things, including AJAX requests, just work.\r\n\r\nI will be providing a modified version to my clients using `e.message` and see what happens, but maybe you know better how/what would be happening in that situation?"

The [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) file in this repository is clear about it, however it is different from the license presented [here](https://js.foundation/pdf/ip-policy.pdf), where both the http://jquery.org/license/ URL and the \"License\" link from the [NuGet package page](https://www.nuget.org/packages/jQuery/) redirect.\r\n\r\nDo I understand correctly, that the LICENSE.txt file in this repository is the \"alternative license\" mentioned in the first paragraph of https://js.foundation/pdf/ip-policy.pdf ? \r\n\r\nEven if yes, I cannot be sure that this file is the same that applies to the distribution from NuGet. The distribution from NuGet, namely the main source file header (jquery-3.1.1.js) points back to http://jquery.org/license, which redirects to https://js.foundation/pdf/ip-policy.pdf so there seems to be no \"license file for the applicable Project\" in this case (i.e. the NuGet distribution case). The confusion stems from the fact that the relation between the NuGet distribution and this repository is only by name - so perhaps it would be better if the NuGet \"License\" link pointed to the LICENSE.txt file here (same in the case of the source file header)?\r\n\r\nAlso, the mentioned header (jquery-3.1.1.js) states that it is released under the MIT License. However it seems that the LICENSE.txt is not a MIT License, strictly speaking. \r\n\r\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating things, but I'm not a lawyer (as, I presume, most of developers) - could you please make the usage conditions more clear? The explanations related to licensing in the context of contributing to jQuery are very clear, but the 3rd-party usage licensing explanations seem to be lacking in this context.\r\n"

We actually use it to identify DOM _nodes_, but even setting aside semantics, there is a case where an object with a truthy `nodeType` property can _avoid_ the DOM node path: [setting data](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/58c6ca9822afa42d3b40cca8edb0abe90a2bcb34/src/data/var/acceptData.js#L16).\r\n\r\nThis means that `.data` can succeed or fail based on some rather trivial differences, which makes me uncomfortable. We should have a single \"is DOM node\" test, applied consistently everywhere. `nodeType` will always have certain characteristics on real DOM nodes (existence, \"number\" type, integer, positive), but we can use any subset thereof\u2014I'm leaning towards `typeof obj.nodeType === \"number\"` or `obj && \"nodeType\" in obj`, because any given kind of input seems unlikely to change classification. And whatever we pick, the style guide will also need an update.\r\n\r\nA macro would be really nice, because it seems silly not to inline such trivial code, but I think we can continue to live without something like [sweet.js](http://sweetjs.org/) for now.\r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\nhttps://jsbin.com/kafudoseno/edit?html,js,console"

    "body": "`.innerWidth()` and `.innerHeight()` no longer return consistent results when scroll bars appear on an element.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the methods returned the size of the box up to the border, whether or not scroll bars are present. (Scroll bars are rendered inside of the border.) That's how the methods behaved from jQuery 1.2.6, when they were introduced, up to jQuery 3.1.1.\r\n\r\nStarting with 3.2.0, the area covered by scroll bars is subtracted from the return value in Chrome and Opera (ie, Blink), IE, and Edge. That happens when the `box-sizing` of the element is set to `content-box`.\r\n\r\nSee the [test case at JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/tunobiv/1/edit?html,css,js,output).\r\n\r\nFF is not affected by the bug. Blink and Edge behave correctly when `box-sizing` is set to `border-box`. In IE, the return value is still broken then.\r\n\r\nThe issue doesn't exist in Safari and mobile browsers because they render scroll bars as temporary overlays which don't take up space in the element.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the bug is a direct result of the fix #3561 for #3193. In `getWidthOrHeight`, you have switched to computed values for establishing the dimensions. You had used `getBoundingClientRect()` previously, and `offsetWidth`/`offsetHeight` before that.\r\n\r\nI totally appreciate the difficulties raised in #3193. Still, the new approach backfires with regard to scroll bars. FF places them inside of the padding edge, while Blink and Edge place them inside of the inner border edge, but outside of the padding edge.\r\n\r\nThat difference between browsers doesn't matter when gBCR or offsetWidth/Height are queried. It also doesn't matter for the computed values of `width` and `height` as long as they are based on the border box (well, except in IE, for whatever reason). But it does change the computed values for the size of the content box, in the affected browsers."

Therefore, ```toString.call(obj)``` reports as ```[object Array Iterator]``` instead of simply ```[object Array]```, which jQuery has no awareness of in the ```class2type``` map. The goal would be to update the ```class2type``` map for that support so these arrays report themselves as arrays instead of objects.\r\n\r\nI know there has been some contention with this type checking in the past, specifically around the ```Error``` object, so I decided to open an issue for discussion before submitting a PR with the changes proposed below.\r\n\r\n### Proposed changes\r\nNot sure the best way to provide a test case for this. Instead,  [this is the code change](https://github.com/danahartweg/jquery/commit/a6bf56006dd21604e45850d314251db64ac856d1) I had in mind."

Either the 'unsafe-inline' keyword, a hash ('sha256-KAcpKskREkEQf5B3mhDTonpPg34XnzaUC5IoBrOUrwY='), or a nonce ('nonce-...') is required to enable inline execution.\r\n\r\nThe error is produced on line 82 of the main jquery.js script file. The content of this line is:\r\ndoc.head.appendChild( script ).parentNode.removeChild( script );\r\n\r\nBasically, it adds an inline script tag to the DOM, and violates the CSP.\r\n\r\nI do not want to use 'unsafe-inline'. Is there any other way to circumvent this error? \r\n\r\nAs you can see on the CSP violation, I'm using CSP level 2 (nonce).

When either attribute is omitted, the dropdown works as expected. When either is omitted, but subsequently set via .attr() method, it also works as expected.\r\n\r\nI could only reproduce this behaviour in Firefox. It works fine in Internet Explorer (11) and Chromium (48). I am using Firefox 51.0.1 (64-bits) on Windows 7. I must add that I am not sure whether the problem is with Firefox or with jQuery, but decided to report it here. If you can estabish the problem is not with jQuery, then please let me know and I will pass it on to Mozilla. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/afxn9sxg/2/\r\n* Select \"Option 2\" from the dropdown. It will return Option 1 instead. Now select \"Option 3\" from the dropdown and it will return Option 2. From this point you can select anything and it will work as expected.\r\n* Run Fiddle again. Now select \"Option 3\". Again it will return Option 1, but now you can select \"Option 3\" and it will return the correct value.\r\n"

The image, div, etc. slides off the screen when the divisions are meant to be mobile compatible (width/height are percentages, display:inline-block, etc.). To get around this, using float with set widths and heights can solve the problem. This is not technically a bug for slideToggle but since it is a common issue scenario for mobile applications, I thought I would post it here to add to tutorials or whatnot. Also, I figured that since some applications require display:inline-block instead of float, this information would be useful.\r\n\r\nPROBLEM\r\nNOTE: In both examples, some parent has declared a width and a height as 100%\r\nNOTE: Both code examples display exact height and width to show how they do not effect the result.\r\nscript\r\njQuery(document).ready(function() {\r\n  jQuery( \"#flip\" ).hover(function() {\r\n    jQuery( \"#flipFront\" ).slideToggle();\r\n    jQuery( \"#flipBack\" ).slideToggle();\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n/script\r\n\r\ndiv style=\"**display: inline-block;** height: 270px; margin: 5px;\"\r\ndiv id=\"flip\" class=\"flip\" style=\"height: 270px; width: 270px;\"\r\ndiv id=\"flipBack\" class=\"back\" style=\"display: none; height: 270px; width: 270px; background-color: #0077bb; color: #ffffff; box-shadow: 4px 4px 4px #333333; vertical-align: top; padding: 5px;\"\r\nh4 Text Here /h4\r\n/div\r\ndiv id=\"flipFront\" class=\"front\" style=\"display: contents; height: 270px; width: 270px;\"><img id=\"imgFlipFront\" style=\"box-shadow: 4px 4px 4px; width: 270px; height: 270px;\" src=\"images/flip.jpg\" /\r\n/\r\n/div\r\n/div\r\n/div\r\n\r\nSOLUTION\r\nscript\r\njQuery(document).ready(function() {\r\n  jQuery( \"#flip\" ).hover(function() {\r\n    jQuery( \"#flipFront\" ).slideToggle();\r\n    jQuery( \"#flipBack\" ).slideToggle();\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n/script\r\n\r\ndiv style=\"**float: left;** height: 270px; margin: 5px;\"\r\ndiv id=\"flip\" class=\"flip\" style=\"height: 270px; width: 270px;\"\r\ndiv id=\"flipBack\" class=\"back\" style=\"display: none; height: 270px; width: 270px; background-color: #0077bb; color: #ffffff; box-shadow: 4px 4px 4px #333333; vertical-align: top; padding: 5px;\"\r\nh4 Text Here /h4\r\n/div\r\ndiv id=\"flipFront\" class=\"front\" style=\"display: contents; height: 270px; width: 270px;\"><img id=\"imgFlipFront\" style=\"box-shadow: 4px 4px 4px; width: 270px; height: 270px;\" src=\"images/flip.jpg\" /\r\n/div\r\n/div\r\n/div\r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\nhttp://www.melissabehrends.com/"

This is in fact allowed by the HTTP specs, particularly if one is developing internal APIs where one also controls the server and backend code etc. It is necessary to be able to to do this in many enterprise APIs which need to send complex queries to decide what to GET (Elastic Search does this a lot, for example). Other current clients like Perl Mojolicious allow this without problems. Not being able to pass body parameters in GET calls forces one to use POST/PUT in situations where it really shouldn't be used and makes one of the HTTP verb slots for an API endpoint useless in some cases.\r\n\r\nI have come across this problem which developing several internal enterprise APIs and it makes using jquery on the client side really difficult.\r\n\r\nPlease consider allowing body parameters for GET calls (in the same request as any query or path params, naturally).\r\n\r\n"

Basically what happens is, when you try to read the `responseText` from an AJAX request that contains several MB worth of data, you can occasionally get an exception that says \"Not enough storage is available to complete this operation\".  When using any version of jQuery however, that exception becomes unhandelable because the error callback isn't called when it happens.\r\n\r\nFrom the callback function in `jQuery.ajaxTransport`:\r\n```javascript\r\ncallback = function( type ) {\r\n\treturn function() {\r\n\t\tif ( callback ) {\r\n\t\t\tcallback = errorCallback = xhr.onload =\r\n\t\t\t\txhr.onerror = xhr.onabort = xhr.onreadystatechange = null;\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif ( type === \"abort\" ) {\r\n\t\t\t\txhr.abort();\r\n\t\t\t} else if ( type === \"error\" ) {\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t// Support: IE <=9 only\r\n\t\t\t\t// On a manual native abort, IE9 throws\r\n\t\t\t\t// errors on any property access that is not readyState\r\n\t\t\t\tif ( typeof xhr.status !== \"number\" ) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplete( 0, \"error\" );\r\n\t\t\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplete(\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// File: protocol always yields status 0; see #8605, #14207\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\txhr.status,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\txhr.statusText\r\n\t\t\t\t\t);\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\t\tcomplete(\r\n\t\t\t\t\txhrSuccessStatus[ xhr.status ] || xhr.status,\r\n\t\t\t\t\txhr.statusText,\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t// Support: IE <=9 only\r\n\t\t\t\t\t// IE9 has no XHR2 but throws on binary (trac-11426)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t// For XHR2 non-text, let the caller handle it (gh-2498)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t( xhr.responseType || \"text\" ) !== \"text\"  ||\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttypeof xhr.responseText !== \"string\" ?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{ binary: xhr.response } :\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{ text: xhr.responseText }, //// ISSUE IS HERE.\r\n\t\t\t\t\txhr.getAllResponseHeaders()\r\n\t\t\t\t);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t};\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom that code you can see, if we fail to read `xhr.responseText` then `complete()` never gets called and it becomes impossible to handle the exception (outside of an 'onerror' handler).\r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\nFrom my research, this issue is notoriously difficult to reproduce.  It involves loading several MB of data over AJAX and possibly requires some memory fragmentation in the browser.  For me, once it starts happening I can almost always get it to happen.  But sometimes it goes away.  If I reduce the response size of my AJAX request enough then it definitely goes away.\r\n\r\nRelevant other instances of people experience the issue (in general, not particularly with jQuery):\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/27405826/internet-explorer-11-not-enough-storage-error\r\nhttps://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/details/1053110/not-enough-storage-is-available-to-complete-this-operation-8007000e-error-when-trying-to-get-a-response-around-100mb-via-ajax\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution ###\r\nThis is a solution I'm proposing.  I would do a pull request but would prefer if somebody on the team could polish it up and get it in.  If not, I'll look into doing a pull.\r\n```javascript\r\n// Callback\r\ncallback = function( type ) {\r\n\treturn function() {\r\n\t\tif ( callback ) {\r\n\t\t\tcallback = errorCallback = xhr.onload =\r\n\t\t\t\txhr.onerror = xhr.onabort = xhr.onreadystatechange = null;\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif ( type === \"abort\" ) {\r\n\t\t\t\txhr.abort();\r\n\t\t\t} else if ( type === \"error\" ) {\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t// Support: IE <=9 only\r\n\t\t\t\t// On a manual native abort, IE9 throws\r\n\t\t\t\t// errors on any property access that is not readyState\r\n\t\t\t\tif ( typeof xhr.status !== \"number\" ) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplete( 0, \"error\" );\r\n\t\t\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplete(\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// File: protocol always yields status 0; see #8605, #14207\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\txhr.status,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\txhr.statusText\r\n\t\t\t\t\t);\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\t    try {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplete(\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\txhrSuccessStatus[ xhr.status ] || xhr.status,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\txhr.statusText,\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// Support: IE <=9 only\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// IE9 has no XHR2 but throws on binary (trac-11426)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// For XHR2 non-text, let the caller handle it (gh-2498)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t( xhr.responseType || \"text\" ) !== \"text\"  ||\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttypeof xhr.responseText !== \"string\" ?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t{ binary: xhr.response } :\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t{ text: xhr.responseText },\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\txhr.getAllResponseHeaders()\r\n\t\t\t\t\t);\r\n\t\t\t\t} catch ( e ) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplete( 0, \"error\", e ); // This would require further change\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t};\r\n};\r\n```\r\nNote: all I did was add a `try` in the `else` block.  Since I want the exception passed into `complete()` that would also require changes to the `done()` function in `ajax` along with API/backwards compatibility considerations.  So I'm leaving that as optional and up to the powers-that-be.  But I think it would be good to include it so we can tell what the error was not simply that there was an error."

This is often harmless (since the animation is revisited in the next tick), but can introduce visible stutter or (in a pathological case that I didn't bother demonstrating) starve an animation outright.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, because `tick` iterates to the end of the queue, _new_ animations get processed twice in their first tick.\r\n\r\nWe should fix both by making the three functions more aware of and cooperative with each other.\r\n\r\n### Link to test cases ###\r\n* [stutter](https://jsfiddle.net/2v6cyorf/)\r\n* [extra processing](https://jsfiddle.net/4peg0sL9/)"

See here for issues related to `left` and `top` styles:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3448\r\n\r\nAnd not at all clear what this comment is supposed to mean:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Get width or height on the element, requesting but not forcing parseFloat\r\n```\r\n\r\nDigging deeper, here are the \"hooks\" for computing the various flavors of height and width to the pixel:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\njQuery.each( [ \"height\", \"width\" ], function( i, name ) {\r\n\tjQuery.cssHooks[ name ] = {\r\n\t\tget: function( elem, computed, extra ) {\r\n\t\t\tif ( computed ) {\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t// Certain elements can have dimension info if we invisibly show them\r\n\t\t\t\t// but it must have a current display style that would benefit\r\n\t\t\t\treturn rdisplayswap.test( jQuery.css( elem, \"display\" ) ) &&\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t// Support: Safari 8+\r\n\t\t\t\t\t// Table columns in Safari have non-zero offsetWidth & zero\r\n\t\t\t\t\t// getBoundingClientRect().width unless display is changed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t// Support: IE <=11 only\r\n\t\t\t\t\t// Running getBoundingClientRect on a disconnected node\r\n\t\t\t\t\t// in IE throws an error.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t( !elem.getClientRects().length || !elem.getBoundingClientRect().width ) ?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tswap( elem, cssShow, function() {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn getWidthOrHeight( elem, name, extra );\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t} ) :\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgetWidthOrHeight( elem, name, extra );\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t},\r\n\r\n\t\tset: function( elem, value, extra ) {\r\n\t\t\tvar matches,\r\n\t\t\t\tstyles = extra && getStyles( elem ),\r\n\t\t\t\tsubtract = extra && augmentWidthOrHeight(\r\n\t\t\t\t\telem,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tname,\r\n\t\t\t\t\textra,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tjQuery.css( elem, \"boxSizing\", false, styles ) === \"border-box\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\tstyles\r\n\t\t\t\t);\r\n\r\n\t\t\t// Convert to pixels if value adjustment is needed\r\n\t\t\tif ( subtract && ( matches = rcssNum.exec( value ) ) &&\r\n\t\t\t\t( matches[ 3 ] || \"px\" ) !== \"px\" ) {\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\telem.style[ name ] = value;\r\n\t\t\t\tvalue = jQuery.css( elem, name );\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\treturn setPositiveNumber( elem, value, subtract );\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t};\r\n} );\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn a side note, we should simply throw an exception for disembodied elements or those with a `display` style of `none`. It's never been a good idea to try to show the latter, measure and then re-hide. As the documentation alludes to, it may not even \"work\" (not even sure what working would imply for such elements).\r\n\r\n> jQuery will attempt to temporarily show and then re-hide an element in order to measure its dimensions, but this is unreliable...\r\n\r\nNo kidding, considering it arbitrarily decides on `block` for the temporary display style, in some cases:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Swappable if display is none or starts with table\r\n// except \"table\", \"table-cell\", or \"table-caption\"\r\n// See here for display values: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/display\r\nrdisplayswap = /^(none|table(?!-c[ea]).+)/,\r\ncssShow = { position: \"absolute\", visibility: \"hidden\", display: \"block\" }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd can't tell at a glance (or from the \"support\" comment) what is supposed to happen with elements without parents (or that are part of document fragments). Nothing good I expect, but I digress (do that a lot with such stuff as every issue seems to lead to a half-dozen more).\r\n\r\nRegardless, such results are *less* than meaningless if the element had the display style of `none`; they are completely confusing. Best to get rid of all that junk as the documentation also alludes to:\r\n\r\n> This show-and-rehide measurement feature may be removed in a future version of jQuery.\r\n\r\nSo deprecate the practice immediately (e.g. log a warning that it is going away in the future, preferably the very near future).\r\n\r\nDrilling down again, here is the `getWidthOrHeight` function:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction getWidthOrHeight( elem, name, extra ) {\r\n\r\n\t// Start with offset property, which is equivalent to the border-box value\r\n\tvar val,\r\n\t\tvalueIsBorderBox = true,\r\n\t\tstyles = getStyles( elem ),\r\n\t\tisBorderBox = jQuery.css( elem, \"boxSizing\", false, styles ) === \"border-box\";\r\n\r\n\t// Support: IE <=11 only\r\n\t// Running getBoundingClientRect on a disconnected node\r\n\t// in IE throws an error.\r\n\tif ( elem.getClientRects().length ) {\r\n\t\tval = elem.getBoundingClientRect()[ name ];\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t// Some non-html elements return undefined for offsetWidth, so check for null/undefined\r\n\t// svg - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=649285\r\n\t// MathML - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=491668\r\n\tif ( val <= 0 || val == null ) {\r\n\r\n\t\t// Fall back to computed then uncomputed css if necessary\r\n\t\tval = curCSS( elem, name, styles );\r\n\t\tif ( val < 0 || val == null ) {\r\n\t\t\tval = elem.style[ name ];\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t// Computed unit is not pixels.

And if expecting an `undefined` value, why does the subsequent check test for negative numbers, zero, `null` *and* `undefined`?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, XML elements (other than XHTML, which jQuery has never supported) aren't expected to have `offsetWidth` properties (which aren't checked here in any event). Do see calls to [`getClientRects`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getClientRects) [`getBoundingClientRect`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect), both of which work with XML elements.\r\n\r\nContinuing on to what happens if any of the above conditions are true:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Fall back to computed then uncomputed css if necessary\r\nval = curCSS( elem, name, styles );\r\nif ( val < 0 || val == null ) {\r\n\tval = elem.style[ name ];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn \"uncomputed\" style is clearly not an appropriate fallback for a computed style.\r\n\r\nThere's more intrigue in the `augmentWidthOrHeight` function, but I think the point is made.\r\n\r\nHave to stop at this point and ask how any of this code is ever maintained with even the slightest degree of confidence? Can only figure that gathering evidence through testing is the only confirmation that updates to the logic make sense, but such evidence proves *nothing* in browser scripting as browsers are perpetually updated (almost constantly these days), old bugs fixed, new bugs introduced, etc.\r\n\r\nAnyway, enough of all *that*; let's start with `innerWidth` (`innerHeight` is the same story of course). According to the documentation:\r\n\r\n> Description: Get the current computed inner width for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding but not border.\r\n\r\nUse of the term \"computed\" (as in computed styles) is confusing as it would imply a string with units, but it goes on to say:\r\n\r\n> This method returns the width of the element, including left and right padding, in pixels.\r\n\r\nSo combining the information in the two statements, can ascertain it returns a number of pixels, including any padding, but not the border. In other words, for *HTML* elements:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nreturn elem.clientWidth;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeems really silly to jump through all of the previous hoops to try to deal with XML elements in the same function; but, in any event, it would be much easier to figure out what sort of element we are dealing with (HTML or XML) and act accordingly. They simply require different approaches. Realize that much of the hoops described above are actually specific to HTML elements as - for example - SVG elements (the most common XML elements found in HTML DOMs) have no CSS padding or borders to add or subtract.\r\n\r\nMoving on to outerWidth, which is documented as:\r\n\r\n> Returns the width of the element, including left and right padding, border, and optionally margin, in pixels.\r\n\r\nIn other words, unless the margin is requested:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nreturn elem.offsetWidth;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs far as the optional margin for the \"outer\" methods, that was clearly a design mistake. Doesn't necessarily require computing styles either, but would require some additional hoops to figure reliably without it. I'd deprecate that option as well and can't imagine a practical use case for it in any event. See the proposed solution to this issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3448\r\n\r\nFor HTML elements, those two one-liners have been the standard in MSHTML since 1997 (IE 4). For other rendering engines, it's been the standard since around the turn of the century. For XML elements, a completely different approach is required and it won't resemble anything in the existing code. Would have been a much better idea to have a separate constructor (i.e. \"subclass\") for XML elements (as well as windows and documents).\r\n\r\nThe current design, which dates back to 2006, is the cause of many of the seemingly never-ending issues with jQuery. A proper design simply wouldn't be susceptible to many of the issues I see created here year after year and the situation won't change until the design problems are addressed. Starting from the inside is the only way to go at the moment as new constructors will require a complete reboot (would be jQuery in brand name only).\r\n\r\nAlso note that setting a dimension and then calling the same method without a dimension may well return a different number. But not even going to get into the \"setter\" bit at this point.\r\n\r\nPS. The documentation for `outerWidth` states:\r\n\r\n> This method is not applicable to window and document objects;\r\n\r\n...which is clearly not the case for `window` references.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nreturn funcName.indexOf( \"outer\" ) === 0 ?\r\n    elem[ \"inner\" + name ] :\r\n    elem.document.documentElement[ \"client\" + name ];\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot entirely reliable, but it does indeed try to get some semblance of an outer width for `window` objects.\r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\n\r\nNo test cases required. Logic is clearly wrong and documentation confirms the code doesn't always work as advertised."

It returns a reference to `window` if passed a reference to a `window` or `document` node, but it returns `false` if passed a reference to an element node.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, it seems very odd to try to derive a `window` reference at all, considering that many methods simply reference the `window` that is passed to the core during initialization.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Miscellaneous\r\n\"target\": function( elem ) {\r\n\tvar hash = window.location && window.location.hash;\r\n\treturn hash && hash.slice( 1 ) === elem.id;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr perhaps that's just a bug. Do see that some methods at least attempt to work with multiple windows. But I digress.\r\n\r\nThe inappropriately named `getWindow` function is used in two places. As always, if we can reduce that number to one, we can get rid of the function (and the costs associated with calling it).\r\n\r\nFirst one is in the `offset` method:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ndoc = elem.ownerDocument;\r\nwin = getWindow( doc );\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo that obviously reduces to:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ndoc = elem.ownerDocument;\r\nwin = doc.defaultView;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe other is here:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Create scrollLeft and scrollTop methods\r\njQuery.each( { scrollLeft: \"pageXOffset\", scrollTop: \"pageYOffset\" }, function( method, prop ) {\r\n\tvar top = \"pageYOffset\" === prop;\r\n\r\n\tjQuery.fn[ method ] = function( val ) {\r\n\t\treturn access( this, function( elem, method, val ) {\r\n\t\t\tvar win = getWindow( elem );\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif ( val === undefined ) {\r\n\t\t\t\treturn win ? win[ prop ] : elem[ method ];\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif ( win ) {\r\n\t\t\t\twin.scrollTo(\r\n\t\t\t\t\t!top ? val : win.pageXOffset,\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttop ? val : win.pageYOffset\r\n\t\t\t\t);\r\n\r\n\t\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\t\telem[ method ] = val;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}, method, val, arguments.length );\r\n\t};\r\n} );\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat confirms the function is expected to return a \"falsey\" value when passed an element reference. Something like this should replace the `getWindow` call:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar win;\r\n\t\t\t\r\nif ( elem.window === elem ) {\r\n\twin = elem;\r\n} else if ( elem.nodeType == 9 ) {\r\n\twin = elem.defaultView;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n...and then that function can be deleted.\r\n\r\nOne less `isWindow` call in the bargain as well. As that one is public, it will have to be deprecated rather than deleted. That's next.\r\n\r\nHTH\r\n\r\nPS. Consider that a large number of issues are related to the ill-advised design of the object model, which tries to deal with elements, documents and windows (among other things) using a *single* constructor. It's an awkward interface for users as well. Was a similar mistake with `attr`, which tried to deal with both (HTML) properties and (XML) attributes using a single function.\r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\n\r\nNo test case needed.

The `document.defaultView.getComputedStyle` (incorrectly referenced as `window.getComputedStyle` in jQuery) method is a hideously complex black box that virtually never needs to be opened. In twenty years of browser scripting, I've managed to avoid it almost entirely (exception that comes to mind was an HTML editor).\r\n\r\nRegardless, jQuery aspires to fix the whole thing and frequently gets into trouble. Consider this \"hook\" for the `top` and `left` styles:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Support: Safari <=7 - 9.1, Chrome <=37 - 49\r\n// Add the top/left cssHooks using jQuery.fn.position\r\n// Webkit bug: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29084\r\n// Blink bug: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=589347\r\n// getComputedStyle returns percent when specified for top/left/bottom/right;\r\n// rather than make the css module depend on the offset module, just check for it here\r\njQuery.each( [ \"top\", \"left\" ], function( i, prop ) {\r\n\tjQuery.cssHooks[ prop ] = addGetHookIf( support.pixelPosition,\r\n\t\tfunction( elem, computed ) {\r\n\t\t\tif ( computed ) {\r\n\t\t\t\tcomputed = curCSS( elem, prop );\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t// If curCSS returns percentage, fallback to offset\r\n\t\t\t\treturn rnumnonpx.test( computed ) ?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tjQuery( elem ).position()[ prop ] + \"px\" :\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcomputed;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t);\r\n} );\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe cryptically named `support.pixelPosition` flag refers to a test result where a percentage-based `top` style fails to compute to pixel units. This is an issue that dates back to the bad old days of IE 8-, where `currentStyle` was frequently used by libraries as a slightly-off substitute for `getComputedStyle`; it didn't convert *any* units to pixels. jQuery certainly does this in older versions, so the problem should be familiar.\r\n\r\nThis is the part that attempts to fix the issue:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// If curCSS returns percentage, fallback to offset\r\nreturn rnumnonpx.test( computed ) ?\r\n\tjQuery( elem ).position()[ prop ] + \"px\" :\r\n\tcomputed;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt calls the `position` method instead, which attempts to figure the *offset* of the element from the document origin, which would only be equivalent to the computed `left` and `top` styles in only a small subset of cases.\r\n\r\nFor example, an element with a position style of `absolute` with all parent elements having position: `static` would work. On the other hand, an element with `fixed` position would fail *unless* the document's scroll position is its origin. Furthermore, an element with `relative` position would fail in virtually every case. And so on, this \"hook\" will simply cause browsers demonstrating this quirk to return nonsensical position values in numerous cases (not even considering problems related RTL documents).\r\n\r\nFor those who never bothered to read my \"P is for Position\" primer on the old cinsoft.net site (now retired) or the numerous Usenet articles I authored on this subject (dating back to at least 2008), I'll go over the general solution again.\r\n\r\nIn short:\r\n\r\n1. Save the `left` or `top` style (e.g. `elem.style.left`).\r\n2. Get the offset.\r\n3. Set the `left` or `top` style to `'0'`.\r\n4. Get the offset again.\r\n5. Find the *difference* between the two offsets.\r\n6. Put the old `left` or `top` style back.\r\n\r\nAnd as the `offset` method is just a pointless wrapper for `getBoundingClientRect` (seems to exist only to handle calls passing disembodied elements or elements with a display style of `none`), would advise simply calling `getBoundingClientRect` and documenting that trying to compute position styles (or offsets) for such elements will result in undefined behavior (a recurring theme here). In addition, to let callers know they made a mistake at the earliest possible time, throw an exception in such cases (as opposed to returning zeros).\r\n\r\nHTH\r\n\r\nPS. What about `right` and `bottom` positions? The solution as it sits is only half-finished. Luckily I archived the related primer years ago:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/david-mark/My-Library/blob/master/position.html\r\n\r\nPPS. As this is an old issue that surely affects previous jQuery versions, am curious as to how the old versions are kept up to date when bugs like this are fixed.\r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\n\r\nNo test case needed. Logic is clearly incorrect."

Not to mention that, as most `ready` callbacks deal in the initial showing and/or enabling of UI components, it is absolutely critical that they run in the same call stack, preventing the browser from doing *anything* (e.g. processing user input) in between.\r\n\r\nFor example, there could very well be mashups out there that assume that `load` listeners are guaranteed to run *after* the `ready` \"event\" fires. We know that was never true, but now we've added all sorts of new and bizarre possibilities.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Catch cases where $(document).ready() is called\r\n// after the browser event has already occurred.\r\n// Support: IE <=9 - 10 only\r\n// Older IE sometimes signals \"interactive\" too soon\r\nif ( document.readyState === \"complete\" ||\r\n\t( document.readyState !== \"loading\" && !document.documentElement.doScroll ) ) {\r\n\r\n\t// Handle it asynchronously to allow scripts the opportunity to delay ready\r\n\twindow.setTimeout( jQuery.ready );\r\n\r\n} else {\r\n\r\n\t// Use the handy event callback\r\n\tdocument.addEventListener( \"DOMContentLoaded\", completed );\r\n\r\n\t// A fallback to window.onload, that will always work\r\n\twindow.addEventListener( \"load\", completed );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould also seem critical not to break compatibility with previous jQuery versions with regard to this behavior.\r\n\r\nIn short, this operation needs to be kept as simple as possible. The implementation in jQuery 3 fails this requirement; in other words, it's asking for (and causing) trouble on multiple levels:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// The deferred used on DOM ready\r\nvar readyList = jQuery.Deferred();\r\n\r\njQuery.fn.ready = function( fn ) {\r\n\r\n\treadyList\r\n\t\t.then( fn )\r\n\r\n\t\t// Wrap jQuery.readyException in a function so that the lookup\r\n\t\t// happens at the time of error handling instead of callback\r\n\t\t// registration.\r\n\t\t.catch( function( error ) {\r\n\t\t\tjQuery.readyException( error );\r\n\t\t} );\r\n\r\n\treturn this;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse of the very complicated `Deferred` object perpetually causes unit tests to fail due to operations failing to complete on schedule. Should be hint enough not to tangle up `ready` callbacks with that code. Furthermore, `Deferred` callbacks are wrapped in timeouts with *unspecified* delays.\r\n\r\nThis is all just begging for trouble; no amount of testing can prove that the scheme will work as expected, *every time* in all browsers. And as we already know how to very simply make the `ready` callbacks run in the correct order every time in all browsers, can't imagine any rationalization for introducing the slightest bit of uncertainty, added complexity or incompatibility.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying that one of the browsers alleged to be \"supported\" in 3 can be easily coaxed into running the callbacks in the wrong order. The point is that no browser (buggy or not) will *ever* run the callbacks in the wrong order if timeouts are *not* used. Using timeouts for this is just pointless and ill-advised.\r\n\r\nThen we throw exceptions in *another* timeout:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\njQuery.readyException = function( error ) {\r\n\twindow.setTimeout( function() {\r\n\t\tthrow error;\r\n\t} );\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is doubling down on the pointlessness.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, all these unneeded, ill-advised timeouts are absolute *poison* for debugging; in the event of an exception, it's obviously best to break on the line that failed (with an intact aftermath environment to inspect), not in a timed anonymous callback. In short, we are just getting in the way of debugging for no good reason.\r\n\r\nThink of the debugger as a cop. It's always better to catch the perpetrator of a crime (an unexpected occurrence causing an exception) at the scene so that evidence can be gathered *immediately*. Catching an exception and re-throwing it after a delay is like reviewing a tape of the crime and filing a report about it later (after the scene has been long since contaminated). Sometimes the perp strikes again in predictable fashion and sometimes they don't; best to catch them the *first* time.\r\n\r\nFinally, there's the obvious fact that this very critical behavior has been wildly changed from what would have been expected in previous versions (themselves no great examples of consistency in this department).\r\n\r\nI read the brief attempt at an explanation for this decision in the issue created for the debugging issues (revisited here). I'm not buying the \"consistent interface\" line; don't even understand what it means. It's neither consistent with previous jQuery versions, nor with what browsers are expected to do with code like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\r\n    ...\r\n});\r\n\r\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\r\n    ...\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot that I think it's good form to use two such listeners, but they should be expected to be called in the correct sequence and *nothing* will happen in between the two calls. On the other hand, if timeouts are thrown into the mix:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\r\n    window.setTimeout(function() {\r\n        ...\r\n    }, 1);\r\n\r\n    window.setTimeout(function() {\r\n        ...\r\n    }, 1);\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n...it opens up the possibility of the browser handling asynchronous events in between the two calls. This second example is similar to what jQuery is now doing. I say similar as there is also the extra complexity of the Promise-like `Deferred` behavior. And, of course, delays are unspecified in jQuery, presumably to save the extra two bytes. :(\r\n\r\nWould take a much better explanation to rationalize this very clearly wrong move. Haven't bothered going back to read the related discussions as know from experience that no rational explanation is possible.\r\n\r\nPlease don't take my word alone on this one. Ask around in any reputable forum for ECMAScript and browser scripting. Ask anybody with experience going back to last decade if they've ever heard of weird things happening related to timeout ordering or if wrapping callbacks in try-catch (or throwing exceptions in timeouts) should be expected to improve or degrade the debugging experience.\r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\n\r\nNo test case needed. Don't need to go looking for trouble in such a case."

Lessons learned in this refactoring will apply to much of the rest of the code.\r\n\r\nLet's go over it bit by bit.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// We shouldn't call jQuery.extend from inside the core (outside code could change or delete it)\r\n// Extra dot operations affect performance as well\r\nvar extend;\r\n\r\nextend = jQuery.extend = jQuery.fn.extend = ( function() {\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs noted, it is unsafe (and a drag on performance) to call `jQuery` methods from inside the module. The object is \"exported\" by tacking it onto the `window` object, which adds it to the global scope. See here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3440\r\n\r\nSo we create a local `extend` function for the recursive calls. Another issue should be created to address all of the other references to `jQuery.extend`.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n/* eslint-disable eqeqeq */\r\n// Extra \"=\" makes no sense when both sides are always the same type\r\n// TODO: Adjust lint rules so this is required only when it makes sense\r\n```\r\n\r\nESLint is simply misconfigured as the extra `=` is redundant in cases where both sides of the comparison are the same type. Furthermore, it is inconsistent as the loose *inequality* operator is used throughout jQuery without any warnings or disabling of the lint (e.g. `!= null`).\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// jQuery.isPlainObject is deprecated\r\nfunction isPlainObject( obj ) {\r\n\tvar proto;\r\n\r\n\tif ( toString.call( obj ) == \"[object Object]\" ) {\r\n\t\tproto = getProto( obj );\r\n\r\n\t\t// Objects foolish enough to have their own - hasOwnProperty - method are not supported\r\n\t\treturn !proto || !proto.hasOwnProperty || proto.hasOwnProperty( \"hasOwnProperty\" );\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\treturn false;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was the *last* function to reference the now deprecated `isPlainObject`. So moved a slimmed down version of it to this function. Some parts of the original are redundant for its use in `extend`, so were thrown out. See here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3430\r\n\r\nNote that objects passed to `extend` that are foolish enough to have a custom `hasOwnProperty` property on their constructor's prototype are not supported. If squeamish about that, we can change to (or add) another method to this check. Also note that the function is no longer susceptible to meddling with `constructor` properties or outside changes to the `jQuery` object (e.g. overriding the `isPlainObject` method). And finally note that the use of `hasOwn` instead of the `hasOwnProperty` method of the prototype would be redundant here. Already checked that the object has a prototype and custom `hasOwnProperty` properties are explicitly disallowed (behavior for such prototypes is undefined).\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nreturn function() {\r\n\tvar source, name, sourceProperty, targetProperty, clonedTargetProperty,\r\n\t\ttarget = arguments[ 0 ],\r\n\t\ti = 1,\r\n\t\tlength = arguments.length,\r\n\t\tdeep = false;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe return the inner function to create a closure containing the now \"private\" `isPlainObject` function. Note that `target` was originally assigned:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ntarget = arguments[ 0 ] || {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis made no sense. The [documentation for this method](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.extend/) indicates that the first (or second on \"deep\" usage) is to be an *object*. For example, the original assignment would allow for `false`, in contradiction with this admonition in the documentation:\r\n\r\n> Warning: Passing false for the first argument is not supported.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, passing an empty string, the number `0` or `null` for this argument would have the same undocumented effect. The behavior for all of these cases should be undefined (i.e. pass nonsense at your own risk and expect exceptions). The best way to help users more quickly identify such missteps is with \"scaffolding\" code that can be removed for production builds:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Example only\r\nif ( typeof target == \"number\" ) {\r\n    throw new Error( \"Please pass objects, not numbers!\" );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLeave that for a future issue as AFAIK, the \"compiler\" has no such capabilities at this time.\r\n\r\nOn this subject, this bit was removed:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Handle case when target is a string or something (possible in deep copy)\r\n\tif ( typeof target !== \"object\" && !jQuery.isFunction( target ) ) {\r\n\t\ttarget = {};\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow did we figure that was possible for the \"deep\" use case? The two recursive calls pass only objects (`Object` objects or `Array` objects to be specific). Anyway, one less `isFunction` call, which is good as it will be deprecated in future as well. Like `isPlainObject` and `isArrayLike`, it's simply an overly generalized crutch that encourages poor designs and has suffered from documented issues related to our own poor design decisions in trying to handle both host and native objects with a single function. But I digress, just trying to put all of these suggested changes into context as part of a unified vision that takes into account best practices for ECMAScript and browser scripting (as well as the history of issues with this project).\r\n\r\nThe rest of the modifications are mostly renamed variables, simplified structures, performance improvements and the aforementioned banishment of the \"exported\" `jQuery` object.\r\n\r\nNot impossible that I could have missed something as this was some seriously obfuscated (and under-commented) code; however, it passed all the unit tests on the first try. So if there is something wrong with the refactoring then the unit tests are insufficient. In either case, *something* needs to change.\r\n\r\nAll of these changes are in [my fork](https://github.com/david-mark/jquery), which is starting to diverge considerably from the trunk. I advise that we allot time from the day-to-day issues to concentrate on improvements that make the code easier to follow and are therefore likely to help prevent future issues. The fact that we have perpetual issues over a decade indicates that we need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.\r\n\r\nWe are on a treadmill due to ill-advised design decisions that date back a decade, unclear code (some of which should not be getting past ESLint) and under-documented, overly complicated features. This all leads to users finding bugs and either creating issues here (or simply guessing how to get around them), which continues the cycle of confusion and busywork.\r\n\r\nThese problems weren't considered to be critical during the ascent of this library as the average Web developer had no clue how to deal with difference between the old IE versions, which had varying degrees of deviation from DOM standards. Furthermore, alternative solutions were minimal and usually featured many of the same mistakes. Those days are long gone and this library is very clearly in (much-deserved) decline. If we don't clean up our act now, it will be *gone* in a few years. Not gone from the Web of course; that will take ages, but certainly considered an irrelevant waste of time and mostly harmful (which it is in its present state).\r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\n\r\nBehavior unchanged, other than performance. Mostly about clarity."

Logically, the expression is a no-op. The comment indicates that somebody once saw it cause some side effect in an unspecified version of Safari. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, no lint will pass such a line. This comment confirms that our lint was forced to ignore the transgression.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// eslint rule \"no-unused-expressions\" is disabled for this code\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf a fuse blows, you don't put tinfoil between the contacts; it's trying to tell you that something is wrong.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, what makes us think that the parent of an `OPTION` will be a `SELECT`? Could be an [`OPTGROUP`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/optgroup).\r\n\r\nAs this issue has the potential to foul up form input, it should be given a high priority.\r\n\r\nI'll leave the solution to this one as an exercise for the moment. A solution was given to Resig several years ago and discussed in the old jQuery forum, as well as on Usenet. He mentioned something about not wanting to add an extra line and confirmed that he couldn't find a browser that \"proved\" it didn't work (i.e. show me where it fails). Hint: the no-op line has the answer and discards it. ;)\r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\n\r\nNo test case. Not known for sure where or when it might fail. Do know that `SELECT` elements without at least one `OPTION` containing a `SELECTED` attribute are vulnerable (as that creates an *implicitly* selected `OPTION`).\r\n\r\nLikely not an issue once the page is loaded, but without reviewing the DOM standards, can't say for sure when browsers are required to set the `selected` property to reflect an implicit selection. Instead of worrying about that (or testing), let's just fix the logic.\r\n\r\nPS. There is an attempt at a feature test that sets a flag that isn't checked in relation to the above line, but it is checked in other areas of the code with similar lines:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar input = document.createElement( \"input\" ),\r\n\t\tselect = document.createElement( \"select\" ),\r\n\t\topt = select.appendChild( document.createElement( \"option\" ) );\r\n\r\n\t...\r\n\r\n\t// Support: IE <=11 only\r\n\t// Must access selectedIndex to make default options select\r\n\tsupport.optSelected = opt.selected;\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne problem with that test is that it is testing a *disembodied* `SELECT` and there's certainly no guarantee that it will pass based on any standard that I know of (again, would have to consult the specifications). So false positives for this \"problem\" will likely occur, adding additional no-op execution for no reason at all. I know that jQuery is supposed to work with document fragments, but the `SELECT` tested is without even that.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is it doesn't test the assumed solution to see if it improves the situation, only that there may be a problem. Again, this will result in no-op execution without any reason to expect it will do anything useful.\r\n\r\nA third problem is that the name of the flag (`optSelected`) is not very descriptive of what it is supposed to mean. If it wasn't tacked on to this `support` object, we could make the name as long as we want as the minification process would reduce it. Regardless, saving a few bytes at the expense of clarity is a bad trade (not to mention that HTTP compression will likely end up saving the bytes anyway).\r\n\r\nIf we just fix the logic for the half dozen related lines then we don't need this test at all. And BTW, what does \"Support: IE <= 11 only\" imply? See similar comments throughout and they don't make a lot of sense to me (e.g. the original hack in this case was for some unspecified Safari version)."

We currently add `jQuery` (and another reference to it called `$`) to the global scope, but core modules continue to call methods on the same object. This defeats the purpose of using modules as any outside code can change the methods, potentially breaking code in the core modules (or other modules using jQuery).\r\n\r\nSample line:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar ret = jQuery.merge( this.constructor(), elems );\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnless overwritten (or deleted), that function looks like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nmerge: function( first, second ) {\r\n\t\tvar len = +second.length,\r\n\t\t\tj = 0,\r\n\t\t\ti = first.length;\r\n\r\n\t\tfor ( ; j < len; j++ ) {\r\n\t\t\tfirst[ i++ ] = second[ j ];\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tfirst.length = i;\r\n\r\n\t\treturn first;\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that there is no reference to `this`, so the function doesn't need to be called as a method at all. The extra reference to the jQuery object and dot operation are not only unsafe, but a self-imposed performance penalty. One of *hundreds*.\r\n\r\nLine that makes this unsafe:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nif ( !noGlobal ) {\r\n\twindow.jQuery = window.$ = jQuery;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSame deal if exporting through CommonJS (or the like). Any module using jQuery can break any other module using jQuery.\r\n\r\nAlso note the contradiction in terms (and objects). If \"no global\" then abstain from augmenting the `window` host object. One of several places where the terms \"window\" and \"global\" are used interchangeably; sometimes in the same line.\r\n\r\nAny outside script can simply do something like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$.merge = function() {\r\n   window.alert('I left my wallet in El Segundo!');\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nRelated ticket:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3426\r\n\r\nIn particular, see my last few comments.\r\n\r\nRelated pull request:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/3428\r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\n\r\nNo test case.

    "body": "I'm creating this ticket based on the discussion in the gh-3409 PR from @Litor so we don't forget to review it.\r\n\r\nWith ajax requests using HTTP methods that do not have a request body, such as GET, any provided data is [always processed and removed](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/4e50967725e61a5d71c2792131de61dec0520f9c/src/ajax.js#L594-L620), even if the caller specified `processData: false`. This seems contrary to the documentation which says:\r\n\r\n> The `data` option can contain either a query string of the form `'key1=value1&key2=value2'`, or an object of the form `{key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2'}`. If the latter form is used, the data is converted into a query string using jQuery.param() before it is sent. This processing can be circumvented by setting `processData` to `false`.\r\n\r\nThis behavior was also present before 3.x so it's not any kind of recent regression, but it does seem like a bug. I suppose you could argue that *\"this processing can be circumvented\"* refers only to serializing objects but not to appending the data to the URL, but that interpretation doesn't make sense. Why would someone want `[object Object]` appended to their URL? \ud83d\ude38 \r\n\r\nIf we didn't process `data` at all, it would be possible for a `beforeSend` handler to take an object and stringify it to the URL as desired , something like this currently non-working example:\r\n\r\nhttp://jsbin.com/fucigaqure/edit?html,console\r\n"

I count five cases where it is used in the core. Here is one example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\njQuery.each( [ \"get\", \"post\" ], function( i, method ) {\r\n\tjQuery[ method ] = function( url, data, callback, type ) {\r\n\r\n\t\t// Shift arguments if data argument was omitted\r\n\t\tif ( jQuery.isFunction( data ) ) {\r\n\t\t\ttype = type || callback;\r\n\t\t\tcallback = data;\r\n\t\t\tdata = undefined;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t// The url can be an options object (which then must have .url)\r\n\t\treturn jQuery.ajax( jQuery.extend( {\r\n\t\t\turl: url,\r\n\t\t\ttype: method,\r\n\t\t\tdataType: type,\r\n\t\t\tdata: data,\r\n\t\t\tsuccess: callback\r\n\t\t}, jQuery.isPlainObject( url ) && url ) );\r\n\t};\r\n} );\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis sort of faux \"overloading\" is generally ill-advised in ECMAScript. The above code should make that clear as it is relatively inefficient and hard to follow. We won't clean it up entirely here as can't break compatibility (and one thing at a time).\r\n\r\nWhat do we have in this case? A string or an `Object` object. If it is an object, then it is \"mixed in\" to the object created to house the various options. Obviously this is a strange interface as we could pass `method`, `callback` and `type` twice (once as the named arguments and again in the `url` object).\r\n\r\nHow about this instead?\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\njQuery.each( [ \"get\", \"post\" ], function( i, method ) {\r\n    jQuery[ method ] = function( url, data, callback, type ) {\r\n\r\n        // Shift arguments if data argument was omitted\r\n        \r\n        if ( jQuery.isFunction( data ) ) {\r\n            type = type || callback;\r\n            callback = data;\r\n            data = undefined;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        var options = {\r\n            type: method,\r\n            dataType: type,\r\n            data: data,\r\n            success: callback\r\n        };\r\n        \r\n        // If url is a string...\r\n        \r\n        if (typeof url == 'string') {\r\n            options.url = url;\r\n        } else {\r\n            \r\n            // If not a string, the only other *allowed* possibility is an Object object\r\n            // Calls with anything *other* than a string or an Object object for url\r\n            // will have undefined behavior.\r\n            // The object must have a \"url\" property, otherwise behavior is also undefined\r\n            \r\n            jQuery.extend(options, url);\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        return jQuery.ajax( options );\r\n    };\r\n} );\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd let's get rid of that `isFunction` call as well as that method should get the same treatment in another issue. Just foreshadowing here:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\njQuery.each( [ \"get\", \"post\" ], function( i, method ) {\r\n    jQuery[ method ] = function( url, data, callback, type ) {\r\n\r\n        // Shift arguments if data argument was omitted\r\n        \r\n        if ( typeof data == 'function' ) {\r\n            type = type || callback;\r\n            callback = data;\r\n            data = undefined;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        var options = {\r\n            type: method,\r\n            dataType: type,\r\n            data: data,\r\n            success: callback\r\n        };\r\n        \r\n        // If url is a string...\r\n        \r\n        if (typeof url == 'string') {\r\n            options.url = url;\r\n        } else {\r\n            \r\n            // If not a string, the only other *allowed* possibility is an Object object\r\n            // Calls with anything *other* than a string or an Object object for url\r\n            // will have undefined behavior.\r\n            // The object must have a \"url\" property, otherwise the behavior is also undefined\r\n            \r\n            jQuery.extend(options, url);\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        return jQuery.ajax( options );\r\n    };\r\n} );\r\n```\r\n\r\nBetter, right? Faster and much easier to follow. There's enough going on in that function to start without adding calls to other odd functions.\r\n\r\nIt's important to understand why `isFunction` isn't needed here (or anywhere most likely). It's a *callback*, which must be a `Function` object. Not any old callable object (e.g. host objects), but an object *constructed* by `Function`. All such `Function` objects have the same `typeof` result in all browsers: `'function'`.\r\n\r\nThat's one down and four to go. Not going to bother with the rest until there is some indication of agreement that this strategy is sound. It will be much the same deal for the rest of the calls to this method and then it can be deprecated (shouldn't encourage developers to use such functions either). In the bigger picture, there is a lot more in the core that can be made easier to follow through similar restructuring.\r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\n\r\nNo test case. Behavior is to remain the same, so existing test cases are appropriate."

An exception should stop the show *immediately*.\r\n\r\nAlready know the counter-argument and the answer is simply: the `ready` method is not a \"polyfill\". We don't have to mimic browsers to a T here (and doing so creates the above issues).\r\n\r\nThe re-throw is a recent change, but it does very little to address the issues that always existing in catching exceptions in \"ready\" callbacks.\r\n\r\nWill correct the related code in my fork shortly.\r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\n\r\nThere is no test case for this.

In NodeJS, a reference to a module object will be passed. And in any other ECMAScript environment that lacks a global `window` object, the global object will be passed.\r\n\r\nAlso, not sure what the \"yet\" in the above comment is supposed to mean. Moving on to the start of the function:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n( function( global, factory ) {\r\n\r\n\t\"use strict\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the first function argument is called `global`, which is quite confusing as it may well reference the `window` host object or a NodeJS module. In other environments it will reference the global object.\r\n\r\nThe code continues:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nif ( typeof module === \"object\" && typeof module.exports === \"object\" ) {\r\n\r\n\t\t// For CommonJS and CommonJS-like environments where a proper `window`\r\n\t\t// is present, execute the factory and get jQuery.\r\n\t\t// For environments that do not have a `window` with a `document`\r\n\t\t// (such as Node.js), expose a factory as module.exports.\r\n\t\t// This accentuates the need for the creation of a real `window`.\r\n\t\t// e.g. var jQuery = require(\"jquery\")(window);\r\n\t\t// See ticket #14549 for more info.\r\n\t\tmodule.exports = global.document ?\r\n\t\t\tfactory( global, true ) :\r\n\t\t\tfunction( w ) {\r\n\t\t\t\tif ( !w.document ) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthrow new Error( \"jQuery requires a window with a document\" );\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\treturn factory( w );\r\n\t\t\t};\r\n\t} else {\r\n\t\tfactory( global );\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis line:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nmodule.exports = global.document ?\r\n```\r\n\r\nChecks for the global `document` object (as in browsers), which implies that `global` is a reference to the global object; however, we've seen that `global` may reference one of three types of objects: the `window` object in browsers, some sort of module object in NodeJS (which will surely not have a `document` property) or the global object in some unspecified environments. The comments are of little help as they imply that `global` references a `window` object.\r\n\r\nIt's all quite confusing and there is an inconsistency at the end:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n        else {\r\n\t\tfactory( global );\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll we know at this point is that there is no `module.exports` object. What we *don't* know is whether this `global` object has a `document` object. If it does not, then jQuery will fail as soon as it references `window.document` (the argument name is `window` in the core, which adds additional confusion).\r\n\r\nI've cleared most of this up in these three files:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/david-mark/jquery/blob/master/src/wrapper.js\r\nhttps://github.com/david-mark/jquery/blob/master/src/exports/global.js\r\nhttps://github.com/david-mark/jquery/blob/master/src/.eslintrc.json\r\n\r\nHaven't even bothered to run it as not sure if I am wasting my time here. All need to understand what these changes accomplish and offer feedback before proceeding (or not). I've done about as much as I'm going to do at this point.\r\n\r\nBut there are bigger issues that require more changes. We really should allow passing *both* the global object reference *and* the `window` object to the `factory` function. If only the global object is passed, then the `window` object can be found as a property of that object. I've made this possible in wrapper.js, but the additional argument should also be added to the core script. An example where it should likely be used:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar\r\n\r\n\t// Map over jQuery in case of overwrite\r\n\t_jQuery = window.jQuery,\r\n\r\n\t// Map over the $ in case of overwrite\r\n\t_$ = window.$;\r\n\r\nQuery.noConflict = function( deep ) {\r\n\tif ( window.$ === jQuery ) {\r\n\t\twindow.$ = _$;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tif ( deep && window.jQuery === jQuery ) {\r\n\t\twindow.jQuery = _jQuery;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\treturn jQuery;\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Expose jQuery and $ identifiers, even in AMD\r\n// (#7102#comment:10, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/557)\r\n// and CommonJS for browser emulators (#13566)\r\nif ( !noGlobal ) {\r\n\twindow.jQuery = window.$ = jQuery;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is a case that would seem to call for the global object, not whatever is passing for the `window` object. Just so happens that, in browsers, the two are usually equivalent. Not so in other environments.\r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\n\r\nThere's no test case. The changes I am suggesting should not change the behavior, so the current unit tests will suffice."

This quirk is needed only in the CSS module and yet the data module uses it as well, making `elem.data('-moz-a', 'b')` create an `MozA` key and `elem.data('-ms-a', 'b')` - an `msA` key. Those use cases should be separated.\r\n\r\nDue to needed breaking changes this is 4.0 material.\r\n\r\nP.S.

In doing so I noticed that some of our `:visible` selectors were failing with the newer version - specifically in cases where we have an empty span (with no height and no width, due to its children using e.g., `display:none`).\n\nThe docs for [:visible](https://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/) do state that this change would come into effect with jQuery `3.0.0`, but it seems to have gotten applied to `2.2.X` as well (see: 79bcb29), which was breaking for my application.\n\nHere's a [jsbin](http://jsbin.com/yagemefeji/1/edit?html,js,output) demonstrating the issue.\n\nFirst observe that with jQuery `2.1.4` loaded, each of the test cases are not considered `:visible`, which is consistent with the docs, given that each has a size of `0x0`. Then change the jQuery version to `2.2.4` and note that now all but one case is considered `:visible`, despite the element size not having changed.\n"

In this case, I'm adding buttons that you can drag and resize with jQuery UI.\n\nI've added this function into jQuery to retrieve the element minimum width, which is its text width:\n\n```\n$.fn.textWidth = function(classname) {\n    if (!$.fn.textWidth.fakeElement) {\n        $.fn.textWidth.fakeElement = $(document.createElement('span'));\n    }\n    $.fn.textWidth.fakeElement.addClass(classname || this.attr('class') || '').html(document.createTextNode(this.val() || this.text())).css({\n        position: 'absolute',\n        width: 'auto',\n        height: 'auto',\n        boxSizing: 'content-box',\n        whiteSpace: 'nowrap'\n    }).appendTo(document.body);\n    var width = $.fn.textWidth.fakeElement[0].getBoundingClientRect().width;\n    $.fn.textWidth.fakeElement.removeClass().remove();\n    return width;\n};\n```\n\nNow I should be able to put the minimum width for jQuery UI resizable, but actually I'm getting a wrong width.\n\nAfter a couple of days investigating why it is giving different values, I've found that this happens because the **CLASS** attribute that I've defined for buttons has a config like `color: rgba(169,170,165,1); font: normal 22.22222328186035px/1.3em open sans,sans-serif;` and when I get the text width it retrieves the element width **BEFORE** the `font-family` is applied.\n\nWith the class configuration I've mentioned before, which is the main configurations for my buttons, I get in console a width value of `58.0625px` and a width value of `62.71875px` if I add a timeout function  with 0s delay, before removing the element. Font families are included from external sources and they are working when the function is called on runtime (when clicking the \"Add\" button), so the problem is not that the page is not loaded or font families weren't loaded.\n\nFor standard button, without changing its class name, the expected/correct value is the second one (`62.71875px`). I hope it is clear enough to understand.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nBest regards.\n## Additional info\n- Version: jQuery 1.11.1\n- Agent: Chrome 53.02785.116m\n"

The content scripts execute in what chrome calls a 'isolated world', i.e., it may see all DOM object, but it is isolated from any scripts that was on the page they are injected into (and vice versa).\n\nCurrently i have isolated my problems down to a race condition, that seems(?) to arise due to the fact that my content script (currently only jQuery) is injected into the page before the DOM is fully initialised(?) or something like that.\n- What do you expect to happen?\n  The jQuery script being injected into the browsed page without any errors, such that it may be referenced from other content scripts.\n- What actually happens\n  I have tried to copy/paste and format the output i get from the chrome console.  As noted before, this error only comes about 80% of the times. So if you try to reproduce, make sure to refresh the site a few times.  It seems to always work on small pages like google.com, however on 'big' pages like newspapers, twitter, facebook, etc it seems to always fail with the below error:\n  - jQuery 1.12.4\n    \n    ```\n    jquery-1.12.4.js:940 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'createElement' of undefined\n        assert                  @ jquery-1.12.4.js:940 \n        (anonymous function)    @ jquery-1.12.4.js:2662\n        (anonymous function)    @ jquery-1.12.4.js:2713\n        (anonymous function)    @ jquery-1.12.4.js:34\n        (anonymous function)    @ jquery-1.12.4.js:38\n    ```\n  - jQuery 2.2.4\n    \n    ```\n    jquery-2.2.4.js:906 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'createElement' of undefined\n        assert                  @ jquery-2.2.4.js:906\n        (anonymous function)    @ jquery-2.2.4.js:2628\n        (anonymous function)    @ jquery-2.2.4.js:2679\n        (anonymous function)    @ jquery-2.2.4.js:34\n        (anonymous function)    @ jquery-2.2.4.js:38\n    ```\n  - jQuery 3.1.1\n    \n    ```\n    jquery-3.1.1.js:927 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'createElement' of undefined\n        assert                  @ jquery-3.1.1.js:927\n        (anonymous function)    @ jquery-3.1.1.js:2746\n        (anonymous function)    @ jquery-3.1.1.js:2797\n        (anonymous function)    @ jquery-3.1.1.js:36\n        (anonymous function)    @ jquery-3.1.1.js:40\n    ```\n  \n  I did some debugging in the 2.2.4 version\n  \n  From the above errors, it is kinda clear (and i debugged it), that `document` is somehow (sometimes) ending up as undefined.\n  \n  ``` javascript\n  905: function assert( fn ) {\n  906:    var div = document.createElement(\"div\");\n  907:\n  ```\n  \n  I boiled it down to the internals of Sizzle, where it should set the internal `document` variable, which is used in the above assert function.  However, this `setDocument()` function sometimes returns early if \"doc is invalid or already selected\"\n  \n  ``` javascript\n  2623: // Initialize against the default document\n  2624: setDocument();\n  ```\n  \n  By printing the `document` variable before and after, i noticed that it is sometimes still undefined after this function, which leads to the above mentioned uncaught type errors.\n  \n  From what i can debug, it all comes down to this \n  \n  ``` javascript\n  1042:   // Return early if doc is invalid or already selected\n  1043:   if ( doc === document || doc.nodeType !== 9 || !doc.documentElement ) {\n  1044:       return document;\n  1045:   }\n  ```\n  \n  Printing `doc`, `document`, `doc.nodeType` and `doc.documentElement` to the console, always yielded in \n  - `doc` being a `HTMLDocument` object, \n  - `document` being undefined, as it hasn't been initialised yet (we are currently doing it),\n  - `doc.nodeType` equal to 9,\n    but \n  - `doc.documentElement` was either a `HTMLHtmlElement` (then obviously it worked), or `null`  and then obviously it didn't work, as it would 'return early' with `document` still being undefined.\n- Which browsers are affected?\n  \n  Currently I have tested this on a Debian machine (Linux evelin 4.6.0-1-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.6.4-1 (2016-07-18) x86_64 GNU/Linux) with Google Chrome (stable 53.0.2785.116-1).  As this is done using a Chrome extension to inject jQuery into the running page i don't really have a means to reproduce this in any other browser.\n\nI don't know if this is a Chrome bug or jQuery, as it seems timing related and that I don't know enough about javascript to say for sure what can be 100% expected to be initialized by the browser before any script is being run.  However currently i have fixed it by placing some busy looping code in the top of the jQuery script, to make sure it is delayed just a few fractions of a sec, that it loads without any errors.\n### Link to test case\n\nYou need a empty directory.  In here you place this \"manifest.json\" file:\n\n``` javascript\n{\n  \"manifest_version\": 2,\n  \"name\": \"jQuery MWE\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1\",\n\n  \"background\": {\n    \"persistent\": false,\n    \"scripts\": [\n      \"eventPage.js\"\n    ]\n  },\n\n  \"permissions\": [\n    \"declarativeContent\",\n    \"<all_urls>\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nand you then place this \"eventPage.js\" file along side (which is responsible for injecting the jQuery file as a content script into the maching web page, which here is any page you browse).\n\n``` javascript\nvar show_page_action = {\n    conditions: [\n        // https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/declarativeContent#type-PageStateMatcher\n        new chrome.declarativeContent.PageStateMatcher({\n            pageUrl: {\n                urlMatches: '.*',\n                //schemes: ['https'],\n            }\n        })\n    ],\n    actions: [\n        new chrome.declarativeContent.RequestContentScript({\n            js: [\"jquery-2.2.4.js\",],\n        })\n    ],\n};\n\n// Make sure our declarativeContent rules are up to date.\nchrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(function (details) {\n    chrome.declarativeContent.onPageChanged.removeRules(undefined, function() {\n        chrome.declarativeContent.onPageChanged.addRules([show_page_action])\n    })\n});\n```\n\nThen of cause you need the jQuery file (above i have used \"jquery-2.2.4.js\") and then you just need to load the directory as a chrome extension.\n\nWhen the extension is loaded, go browse any webpage with the chrome developer tools/console open, and refresh the page a few times until you see the above mention uncaught type error.  Most of the times google.com will work just fine as it seems to load fast enough, so try something with a bit more content on.\n"

    "body": "In Chrome, FX and IE >=10 `<script defer>` should cause scripts to be background loaded, but then executed in order before `DOMContentLoaded` fires. \n\nHowever, when lots of scripts are loaded with `defer` applied the jQuery event fires before all the scripts have run.\n\nYou can test this with:\n\nfile 1.js:\n\n``` javascript\nwindow.test = \"fail init\"; \n// test result when jQuery ready fires\n$(function() {$('#resultJQ').html(\"jQuery result: \" + window.test);});\n\n// test result when document is ready\ndocument.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function() {$('#resultDOM').html(\"DOM result: \" + window.test);});\n```\n\nfile 2-9.js:\n\n``` javascript\nwindow.test = \"fail \" + n; \n```\n\nfile 10.js:\n\n``` javascript\nwindow.test = \"pass\" \n```\n\npage.html:\n\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"jquery.js\" defer></script>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"1.js\" defer></script>\n    ...\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"n.js\" defer></script>\n    ...\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"10.js\" defer></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\"resultJQ\">waiting...</div>\n    <div id=\"resultDOM\">waiting...</div>\n<body>\n</html>\n```\n\nBoth tests pass when files load fast enough, but sufficient delays (>50ms each) in the `*.js` files cause the jQuery test to fail in latest Chrome and FX. It doesn't fail consistently, but the jQuery ready always fires before the document one.\n\n[Here is a jsBin that reproduces it on first load](https://jsbin.com/taremu/edit?html,output), although this might depend on your network and subsequent loads won't show the bug. Try throttling your connection and CTRL+F5 if it doesn't happen on first load.\n\nThis bug is extant in the latest 2.x and 3.x but doesn't seem to occur in 1.x\n\nThis appears to be due to this check:\n\n``` javascript\n// Catch cases where $(document).ready() is called\n// after the browser event has already occurred.\n// Support: IE <=9 - 10 only\n// Older IE sometimes signals \"interactive\" too soon\nif ( document.readyState === \"complete\" ||\n    ( document.readyState !== \"loading\" && !document.documentElement.doScroll ) ) {\n\n    // Handle it asynchronously to allow scripts the opportunity to delay ready\n    window.setTimeout( jQuery.ready );\n}\n```\n\nWhen debugging it appears that `document.readyState === 'interactive'` and `!document.documentElement.doScroll` is true, so `jQuery.ready` fires with the minimum delay (4ms). Breaking on `window.setTimeout` halts execution while some of the numbered js files are still `pending` in the Network tab.\n\nI don't know whether this is a recent change in behavior, but Chrome and Firefox appear to report `document.readyState === 'interactive'` as soon as the body is present, but before deferred scripts are evaluated.\n\nThis isn't a problem in IE < 10 as it doesn't support `defer` (it sort of does, but fires scripts out of order and so would fail this test anyway).\n"

    "body": "### Description\n\nThe $.ajax functionality in regards to the `data` property is not compliant to the RFC spec for HTTP DELETE standards and causes issues. Currently we are running an api behind a Google Compute L7 Load Balancer and are getting 400 error codes when sending DELETE requests using data.\n### Current docs for $.ajax:\n\n**data**\n_Type: PlainObject or String or Array_\nData to be sent to the server. It is converted to a query string, if not already a string. It's appended to the url for GET-requests. See processData option to prevent this automatic processing. Object must be Key/Value pairs. If value is an Array, jQuery serializes multiple values with same key based on the value of the traditional setting (described below).\n### Why not send data in body??\n\nThe HTTP Spec states the following...\n\n> \"A payload within a DELETE request message has no defined semantics; sending a payload body on a DELETE request might cause some existing implementations to reject the request.\"\n\nsite: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.5\n### Who cares what the spec says??\n\nApparently Google does. Here's a response from a cloud support specialist regarding the matter...\n\n> DELETE requests with a payload are rejected at the Google frontend service. As stated at [1] \"A payload within a DELETE request message has no defined semantics; sending a payload body on a DELETE request might cause some existing implementations to reject the request.\" Given that the load balancer does not allow a DELETE request with a body, the workarounds you have are to either use the same URL without a body or use a handler where you can POST the same body and delete the specific topic ID.\n\nI would very much appreciate if you could fix the $.ajax functionality to work correctly per the standards defined [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.5), or a more recent version of the specification. I believe the GET method works in this way and if the DELETE method could be changed to work the same as GET, that would be perfect.\n\nI'm a long time user and fan of jQuery and I look forward to continued use. Thank you for taking a few minutes to review my request.\n"

    "body": "When I tried to update from 1.11.3 to 1.12.4 I noticed that the latest releases broke a lot of old browser versions. Not only did jquery stop working, it totally broke javascript in some of these browsers\n\nI looked into some of the error messages and found solutions:\n1. getComputedStyle() always needs to have a pseudo element in older browsers: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle\n2. addEventListener() always needs to have set useCapture explicitly to false in older browsers: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener\n3. removeEventListener() always needs to have set useCapture explicitly to false in older browsers: \nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener\n\nSetting a few null / false was not much, but had a huge impact. After adding these, in no browser jquery broke javascript completely and some of the browsers now worked totally fine. But sadly in some old browsers there is still one problem which doesn't break javascript but some of the jquery behaviour. This gives of the error message:\n\"div.getClientRects is not a function\"\n\nSince this worked before, I think there should be a way to fix this. How did jquery handle this before 1.12?\n\nAnd my second question: Why did jquery 1.12 suddenly have these \"bugs\" on some places of the code? Was it decided to drop support for these old browsers, or was that a regression introduced by code rewriting?\n\nThanks :)\n"

    "body": "This issue is about listeners with filtering by selector, not just usual listeners. For example:\n\n``` js\n$('...').on('click', '.myClass', func);\n```\n\nNow jQuery is comparing all selectors each time the event occurs, but this is not optimal and take very long time, especially on mobile phones.\n\nYou should use this algorithm:\n1. For example, let it be #id selector. Create object: key -> id, value -> handler.\n2. When the event occurs do something like that:\n   \n   ``` js\n   if (elem.handlerById[elem.id]) elem.handlerById[elem.id]();\n   ```\n3. If you have more than one handler with the same selector filter then merge them into an array.\n4. If you need keep order of calling then add counter to every handler and before calling put them all into array and sort by counter.\n5. You can optimize many other selector. For example, for [attr=value] selector you need two nested object, first for searching by attr, second for searching by value, or just one object for searching by attr + \"=\" + value.\n6. If you care about file size you can implement it as module and put link at the https://api.jquery.com/on/. When user requires module $.fn.on begins to work fast.\n# \n\nThis algorithm works with O(1) speed. Here's example of short implementation that optimize #id selector only, can't work with data, doesn't split handlers by space and doesn't override $.fn.off:\n\n``` js\n$.fn.on_original = $.fn.on;\n\n$.fn.on = function(event, selector, handler) {\n    if (typeof(selector) !== 'string' || !/^#[a-zA-Z0-9_\\-]+$/.test(selector)) {\n        return this.on_original(event, selector, handler);\n    }\n\n    for (var i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {\n        var elem = this[i];\n\n        if (!elem[event]) {\n            elem[event] = {\n                handlerById: {},\n                handlerByClass: {},\n                handlerByConcatAttrAndValue: {},\n            };\n            $(elem).on_original(event, DOMHandler); //Adding common listener without filtering\n        }\n\n        elem[event].handlerById[selector.substr(1)] = handler;\n    }\n};\n\nfunction DOMHandler(e) {\n    var handlerById = this[e.type].handlerById;\n    var targetElem = e.target;\n\n    while (targetElem !== this) {\n        if (handlerById[targetElem.id]) {\n            handlerById[targetElem.id].call(targetElem, e);\n        }\n        targetElem = targetElem.parentNode;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nExample of using:\n\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<div id=\"content\">\n    <div id=\"test10\">\n        <div id=\"fireMe\"></div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<script src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.0/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"jquery.fastOn.js\"></script>\n\n<script>\n    var $content = $('#content');\n    for (var i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {\n        $content.on('myEvent', '#test' + i, logID);\n    }\n\n    var startTime = Date.now();\n\n    // Logs \"test10\".

If the context is not specified or given as null or undefined **or boolean**, a new document is used.\n\nAs a second through, the new document should only be used when keepScripts is true, so maybe change the [line 32](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core/parseHTML.js#L32) : \n`if ( support.createHTMLDocument ) {`\nto\n`if ( support.createHTMLDocument && keepScripts ) {`\n\nThe new document is a strange behaviour (jQuery ui widget cannot work with this type of element because it uses [this.element.ownerDocument to set this.document](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/widget.js#L310), which is not the current document anymore), and should be restricted only to keepScripts = true.\n\nWhat do you think about this ?

    "body": "From http://api.jquery.com/ready/\n\n> There is also $(document).on( \"ready\", handler ), deprecated as of jQuery 1.8. This behaves similarly to the ready method but if the ready event has already fired and you try to .on( \"ready\" ) the bound handler will not be executed. Ready handlers bound this way are executed after any bound by the other three methods above.\n\nWait, what??\n\nSo, I have to remember that I can't use `$(window).load(handler)`, I have to use `$(window).on(\"load\", handler)` instead; but on the other hand, for the `ready` event it's the other way round: I can't use `$(document).on(\"ready\", handler)`, I should use `$(document).ready(handler)` or `$(handler)` instead. And also, `$(handler)` _is_ the same as `$(document).ready(handler)` but it is _not_ the same as `$(document).on(\"ready\", handler)`. Unlike **every** other event, where `$(something).on(\"event\", handler)` _is_ the same as `$(something).event(handler)`.\n\nThat's a lot of gratuitous inconsistencies and a lot of unnecessary things to know that one can easily miss.\n\n`$(document).on(\"ready\", handler)` should not be deprecated, and it should behave the same as `$(handler)`, both in whether it is fired or not and in the order of execution.\n\nI know, you'll tell me that it is not gratuitous and unnecessary, that it is because of how stuff is implementated. However, implementation difficulties should dealt with by implementors, not exposed to the API users.\n"

You haven't deprecated `.click()`, `.ready()`, etc., and you are not going to, are you? Until then, `.load()` shouldn't be deprecated either. It just create unnecessary inconsistency.\n\nI do see the rationale behind it: it is ambiguous with the ajax `.load()` method. Discouraging its use is a good idea, but deprecating it and breaking it is going too far. **Unless** you do the same with all the event-binding shorthand methods such as `.click()`, `.keydown()`, `.ready()` etc. \n(Which wouldn't be such a crazy idea btw if it wasn't for backward compatibility: that has always been a bas API design from the beginning, sacrificing clearness for the sake of saving a few keystrokes in writing code.)\n\n**Consistency** is a must in such a large API as jQuery's.\n\n(by the way, it's ironic that with `.ready()` you did the opposite thing: keeping the `.ready()` method and deprecating `.on(\"ready\")`; just one more inconsistency with even less reason to exist)\n"

Instead, the amount of offset in the window's pageYOffset/pageXOffset properties need to be subtracted out to give a proper top & left registration point for the relatively positioned parent. You also need to subtract out the document element's top & left values in its client rect in case it has been scrolled when panning around the scaled viewport.\n\nThis is how we're handling it in our code once we get the offset back from jQuery: \n\n``` javascript\nvar offset = $(el).offset();\n\n//get document element width without scrollbar\nvar prevStyle = document.body.style.overflow || \"\";\ndocument.body.style.overflow = \"hidden\";\nvar docWidth = document.documentElement.clientWidth;\ndocument.body.style.overflow = prevStyle;\n\nif(docWidth / window.innerWidth !== 1) { //kind of a hack to determine if the viewport has been scaled\n    var docRect = document.documentElement.getBoundingClientRect();\n    offset = {\n        top: offset.top - window.pageYOffset - docRect.top,\n        left: offset.left - window.pageXOffset - docRect.left\n    };\n}\n```\n\nNote: We've only tested this in WebKit based browsers such as Mobile Safari & Chrome.\n\n[JSBin](http://jsbin.com/jacuhakafa/)\n**Testcase Steps**\n- Open link on a touch device (Chromebook Touch/iOS/Android/Surface) in a WebKit browser (Safari/Chrome for example).\n- Spread two fingers gesture to zoom page in.\n- Tap the green box to place a red square within it.\n- Notice that the red square is not placed within its parent correctly.\n"

I reduced the problem to what could be seen in the following fiddler:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/kz3nskf6/1/\n\nBasically after setting the property of all options to false I can't set a selected property using $.attr() method and then read the select value with $.val(). The problem only occurs in IE11 (I haven't tried other versions).\n\nWhile this may seem an odd thing to do I got here since I'm using different jQuery plugins to enhance my selects (multiselect and picklist). I can't programatically clean all selected options by using the prop() method because later on the multiselect will not work anymore but I can't also just use the attr() method since the multiselect uses the prop().\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug or simply a browser limitation (or even the intended behavior). Chrome and Firefox seem to handle that just fine.\n\nI tried several different jQuery versions but without luck.\n\nThanks in advance for your help.\n"

If I'm not mistaken, the first iOS 7 release came with Safari Mobile 6.1 preinstalled in late 2013.\nDoes this mean that Safari Mobile 6.1+ is actively supported by jQuery?

However, its tweening logic uses `Date.now()` instead of the [RAF `timestamp` argument](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame). As a result, the animation is still _slightly_ choppy.\n\nBefore you switch to using `timestamp`, I should point out that the Velocity.js library opts not to use `timestamp` ([velocity.js:3366](https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity/blob/9c9c052a5fb6d5854c9aad931d9410c6790816ee/velocity.js#L3366-L3368)):\n\n```\n/* We ignore RAF's high resolution timestamp since it can be significantly offset\n   when the browser is\n   under high stress; we opt for choppiness over allowing the browser to drop huge\n   chunks of frames. */\nvar timeCurrent = (new Date).getTime();\n```\n\nI don't know if this is actually still an issue in modern browsers. @julianshapiro originally wrote this code in 2014 -- perhaps he can chime in with some details.\n\nI created a test case to demonstrate choppiness resulting from not using `timestamp`: https://codepen.io/joliss/pen/wWKGeV/ (The test case uses Velocity.js, but I believe it's the same for jQuery.)\n\nMy hope is that you can use this test case as a debugging aid, and as a motivating example to convince browser vendors to get any remaining `timestamp` issues resolved.\n\nRunning the CodePen, we see that there is some slight choppiness with the jQuery's `getTime` implementation:\n\n![a pen by jo liss jtbyc](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/524783/15835268/1281d79a-2c27-11e6-9d3e-14e0c735f47b.png)\n\nUsing the RAF `timestamp` argument instead, the animation feels smoother, and the graph is perfectly smooth as well:\n\n![a pen by jo liss her4j](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/524783/15835273/1b4f9f2e-2c27-11e6-8e70-801d7c627b73.png)\n\nI thought that perhaps using the microsecond-resolution `performance.now()` function would improve smoothness, but it doesn't seem to help much:\n\n![a pen by jo liss hft9a](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/524783/15835281/243ff674-2c27-11e6-8ed5-64e5be7da169.png)\n"

What motivated the project to open its source code at Github? How do you evaluate the benefits of this migration?\n2. Does this snapshot make sense? Did you find any inconsistency on the data?\n3. Do you have any internal policy to promote/attract/retain newcomers? If so, do them succeed?\n4.

Then, `.position()` mistakes.\nhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/305f193aa57014dc7d8fa0739a3fefd47166cd44/src/offset.js#L180\nI think that `.offsetParent()` should return `document` or `null` in this case.\n`document` means \"base of coordinates\".\n`null` means \"ancestor element is not found\".\n\nAlso, `.position()` method should return coordinates relative to the document in this case.\n\nAnd also, `.position()` method returns incorrect coordinates when `<html>` has `position:non-static` (i.e. the ancestor element is really `<html>`).\nFor example:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/wczL6ae5/\n\nResult:\n\n```\nClientRect   top: 63   left: 63\nCSS props    top: auto left: auto\n.position()  top: 59   left: 59\nSet return value of `.position()` to `top` and `left`, then the element should not move.\nClientRect   top: 62   left: 62\nCSS props    top: 59px left: 59px\n.position()  top: 58   left: 58\n```\n\n**Note:** `1px` was added by this issue, and `2px` was lost by [another issue of `.offset()`](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3080).\nWhen fixed `.offset()` is used:\n\nResult:\n\n```\nClientRect   top: 63   left: 63\nCSS props    top: auto left: auto\n.position()  top: 61   left: 61\nSet return value of `.position()` to `top` and `left`, then the element should not move.\nClientRect   top: 64   left: 64\nCSS props    top: 61px left: 61px\n.position()  top: 62   left: 62\n```\n\nWhen `.offsetParent()` method returned `<html>`, `.position()` method ignores its offset.\nhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/305f193aa57014dc7d8fa0739a3fefd47166cd44/src/offset.js#L144\nTherefore, if the `<html>` has offset (i.e. `margin`), returned value is incorrect.\nStrange to say, only `border-width` is included in that calculation.\nhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/305f193aa57014dc7d8fa0739a3fefd47166cd44/src/offset.js#L150\n\nI think that it might affect scripts that exist if the return value of `.offsetParent()` method is changed.\nAt least, `.position()` should be fixed even if `.offsetParent()` is not fixed. In this case, `.position()` should not use `.offsetParent()`, or it should check whether `position` is `static` when `<html>` was returned.\nThis issue affects `.offset()` method because setter of `.offset()` uses `.position()`.\n"

    "body": "Hi,\nI found a case that `offset` method returns incorrect value in Firefox.\n`offset` method subtracts `docElem.clientTop/clientLeft` (i.e. `border-width` of `html` element), but Firefox seems to return `0` as `clientTop/clientLeft` of `html` element always.\n\nFor example:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/xwuc0g6q/\n\n``` html\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"box1\"></div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n``` css\nhtml {\n  border: 10px solid red;\n}\n\nbody {\n  border: 10px solid blue;\n\n  margin: 20px;\n  padding: 30px;\n\n  /*position: relative;*/\n}\n\n#box1 {\n  position: absolute;\n  left: 0;\n  top: 0;\n  width: 50px;\n  height: 50px;\n  background-color: green;\n}\n```\n\n``` js\n$(function() {\n\n  var elem = document.getElementById('box1');\n\n  // <html>.clientLeft/clientTop\n  // from https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/305f193aa57014dc7d8fa0739a3fefd47166cd44/src/offset.js#L78\n  var doc = elem.ownerDocument,\n    docElem = doc.documentElement;\n  console.log(docElem.tagName + ' > clientLeft: ' + docElem.clientLeft + ' clientTop: ' + docElem.clientTop);\n\n  // document.body.clientLeft/clientTop\n  var body = document.body;\n  console.log(body.tagName + ' > clientLeft: ' + body.clientLeft + ' clientTop: ' + body.clientTop);\n\n  // getBoundingClientRect\n  var box = elem.getBoundingClientRect();\n  console.log('BoundingBox > left: ' + box.left + ' top: ' + box.top);\n\n  // jQuery#offset\n  var offset = $(elem).offset();\n  console.log('offset() > left: ' + offset.left + ' top: ' + offset.top);\n\n});\n```\n\nRes in Google Chrome:\n\n```\nHTML > clientLeft: 10 clientTop: 10\nBODY > clientLeft: 10 clientTop: 10\nBoundingBox > left: 0 top: 0\noffset() > left: -10 top: -10\n```\n\nRes in IE:\n\n```\nHTML > clientLeft: 10 clientTop: 10\nBODY > clientLeft: 10 clientTop: 10\nBoundingBox > left: 0 top: 0\noffset() > left: -10 top: -10\n```\n\nRes in Firefox:\n\n```\nHTML > clientLeft: 0 clientTop: 0\nBODY > clientLeft: 10 clientTop: 10\nBoundingBox > left: 0 top: 0\noffset() > left: 0 top: 0\n```\n\nBut I can't understand why the method subtracts `docElem.clientTop/clientLeft`.\nIf it do that for getting the position relative to the document, it should calculate based on `border-box` (i.e. outline that includes border). The `box1` element in above code is positioned based on `border-box` even if `html` has border.\nAnd also, `html` usually has no border.\n\nThen, I feel that `left: 0, top: 0` is correct result, and it is useful.\n"

Those characters in ascending unicode order are:\n- tab (`\\t`, U+0009)\n- line feed (`\\n`, U+000A)\n- form feed (`\\f`, U+000C)\n- carriage return (`\\r`, U+000D)\n- space (` `, U+0020)\n\nWhen other characters that are matched by the regular expression pattern `\\s` are used in classes, jQuery fails to behave correctly according to the spec.\n\nA quick example of this failure:\n\n```\n$({\n  nodeType: 1,\n  getAttribute: function () {\n    return 'foo'\n  },\n  setAttribute: function (name, val) {\n    console.assert(val === 'foo foo\\u00A0bar', 'no-break space should not be treated as a class separator');\n    console.log(JSON.stringify(val));\n  }\n}).addClass('foo\\u00A0bar');\n```\n\nwhich produces an assertion failure and `'foo bar'` logged to console.\n\n[fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/8960sop4/)\n\nThe problem is that [`classes.js` uses `rnotwhite`](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/attributes/classes.js#L26) which is (`/\\S+/g`) and _not_ an appropriate regular expression to use for splitting strings of classes.\n"

Wrap the element into jQuery and use the `$.fn.is(:peudo)` selector.\n\nBoth are however wasteful of resources. Given that those methods (taking a single element argument), are already in the code base. They have a legit case to be used directly.

If it is a fragment the element can't be visible, and the result must thus be `true`.

Unfortunately I suppose we've already crossed the Rubicon by calling functions at all, which prevent $.param() from being used as a way to passively serialize an object the way you would with JSON. But I'm still not a fan!\n\nAlthough I am suggesting additional functionality, I tend to agree with @dmethvin 's point of minimizing the behavior of this function (I am a fan of simple and strict rules).\n\nMy thought process being, that if it's allowed on an attribute level, it should certainly be allowed at the root. However, secondarily, I am suggesting that this should **only** be allowed at the root, and to simply ignore method attributes (similar to `JSON.stringify`). _To me_, it would make more sense to pass a function that builds a dynamic object, than to pass an object that can build dynamic properties -almost seems like the tail is wagging the dog. A natural evolution might be to firstly allow this at the root, and to eventually phase out methods on an attribute basis.\n"

    "updated_at": "2018-06-18T19:53:48Z",
    "body": "Hi,\nwhen migrating our code from jQuery 1.11.1 to jQuery 2.2.1, we found a difference between the `jQuery.isPlainObject` implementations in the two versions. This difference also affects other jQuery methods that internally call `isPlainObject`, like `jQuery.extend`. \n\nSee https://jsfiddle.net/tjmgfjg4/1/ for a reduced example with jQuery.extend.\n\nThe reason seems to be that 3dccf62c removed the `try ... catch` around the following check in `isPlainObject`:\n\n``` javascript\n        if ( obj.constructor &&\n                !hasOwn.call( obj.constructor.prototype, \"isPrototypeOf\" ) ) {\n            return false;\n        }\n```\n\nWhen `isPlainObject` is called for an object which has a `constructor` property with a non-falsy, non-function value, it now throws a `TypeError` (\"Cannot convert undefined or null to object\").\n\nI understand that using a property `constructor` with a value other than the original constructor function is somewhat 'unusual' and not best practice. But as far as I can see, this is not prohibited by an Ecmascript spec (up to and including ES2015). I also understand that it is discussable whether such objects should be reported as _plain_ or not. But running into a `TypeError` seems quite unexpected.\n\nAdding the `try ... catch` back might not be the best way to fix this. But maybe the check could be made more robust by some other mean, e.g. adding another condition (motivated by the concrete error) \n\n``` javascript\n        if ( obj.constructor &&\n                typeof obj.constructor.prototype === 'object' &&\n                !hasOwn.call( obj.constructor.prototype, \"isPrototypeOf\" ) ) {\n            return false;\n        }\n```\n\nor by checking whether `obj.constructor` is of type function (motivated by the original intention: check whether the standard `constructor`backlink points to `Object`)\n\n``` javascript\n        if ( typeof obj.constructor === 'function' &&\n                !hasOwn.call( obj.constructor.prototype, \"isPrototypeOf\" ) ) {\n            return false;\n        }\n```\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts about this: regression or valid simplification?\n\nKind Regards, cw\n"

Something like:\n\n```\n$('<iframe>').attr(...).appendTo(document.body).on('load', {some:data}, onload_fn);\n$(form).attr({target: frame_name, ...}).submit();\n```\n1. When I click the \"Upload\" button the form is submitted and all is fine, but...\n2. When I then select any other tab the onload_fn is executed once again. Only once, switching tabs does not execute the onload again... until I create another iframe.\n\nWhat's more the redundant event is also executed when I just close the dialog, so tabs may be not required to reproduce the issue.\n"

Possible values for the second argument (besides `null`) are **`\"timeout\"`**, `\"error\"`, `\"abort\"`, and `\"parsererror\"`. When an HTTP error occurs, `errorThrown` receives the textual portion of the HTTP status, such as \"Not Found\" or \"Internal Server Error.\" As of jQuery 1.5, ... . Note: This handler is not called for cross-domain ... .\n\n`504 Gateway Timeout` error usually occurs when it use a long-time-pending request to wait for some events but there's a **proxy / reverse proxy**, especially reverse proxy such as _nginx vhost_. That means: once the proxy configuration of gateway set a smaller timeout limit than the browser or ajax's `timeout`option, never a `timeout` error can get.\n\nHere's part of [RFC2616 Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.5.5) for reference.\n\n> ### 10.5.5 504 Gateway Timeout\n> \n> The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server specified by the URI (e.g. HTTP, FTP, LDAP) or some other auxiliary server (e.g. DNS) it needed to access in attempting to complete the request.\n> \n> ```\n>   Note: Note to implementors: some deployed proxies are known to\n>   return 400 or 500 when DNS lookups time out.\n> ```\n"

Thus, when `jQuery.Event.preventDefault` is called, the `originalEvent` check fails to detect that the event does not in-fact have a `preventDefault` function.\n\nThis may be an issue that needs to be addressed on the jQuery Mobile side. But, I traced it back to here and, historically, the check existed which causes this issue to pop-up on newer versions of jQuery with jQuery Mobile.\n"

This happens only on elements with position:absolute.\n\nI reproduced the bug in the following environments:\nChrome 48.0.2564.97/OS X 10.11.3\nFirefox 42/OS X 10.11.3\nFirefox 44/OS X 10.11.3\nOpera 35/OS X 10.11.3\nFirefox 44/Windows 7\nEdge 12/Windows 10\n\nThe bug did not occur in IE 9/Windows 7, IE 10/Windows 8, or IE 11/Windows 10 (I did not test any other Internet Explorer versions).\n\nThe bug also occured using jQuery Core 1.12.0.\n"

    "body": "TL;DR, I would love to help reducing jquery's size while keeping the same performance and compatibility\n\nI am the creator of [Umbrella JS](http://umbrellajs.com/), made as a lightweight jquery alternative for modern browsers. I started javascript with jquery many years ago and I'd love to contribute back few things I've learned to try to reduce jquery's size.\n\nWhile reading jquery's code I've realized that there's many things made in that way in the name of performance; however modern browsers and engines are very different. Take for example the `while()` loop vs `.forEach()` or `.reduce()`, that is traditionally considered a performance improvement:\n\n``` js\nvar cur = \"\", i = 0, c;\nwhile ( ( c = arr[ i++ ] ) ) {\n  if ( cur.indexOf( \" \" + c + \" \" ) < 0 ) {\n    cur += c + \" \";\n  }\n}\n```\n\nvs\n\n``` js\n// This can be generalized and moved out\nfunction joinClassNames(prev, name){\n  if (prev.indexOf(\" \" + name + \" \") < 0) {\n    prev += name + \" \";\n  }\n  return prev;\n};\nvar cur = arr.reduce(joinClassNames, \"\");\n```\n\nHowever, now both of these methods are at the same speed (within margin error) as jsperf shows: **[jsperf test](http://jsperf.com/while-vs-foreach-array)**.\n\nWhile they are similar speed, the second one could really help [addClass](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/a4d16a26abe3ea36337f7bfc4d1bfe13b893cd17/src/attributes/classes.js) and other `*Class` methods, since the function itself could be put at the beginning (similarly to `getClass()`) and get reused, slimming down the code.\n\nWith all this said, I'd love to try to contribute back cleaning, reducing and reusing as much source code as possible in jquery. I have a couple of questions though:\n- **Is this a wanted improvement?** The last thing I'd want is to waste jquery's developers time and my time doing something that no one calling the shots is concerned about.\n- **How do I test jquery's performance?** Are there currently performance tests? I'm willing to try to add some, but I'd need some help setting this up. Manually testing each and every change in [jsperf](http://jsperf.com/) is not viable (not reproducible). I [have some setup in Umbrella JS](https://github.com/umbrellajs/umbrella/blob/master/src/test.js#L64) to run in Circle CI.\n\nPS, there was some discussion going on [in issue #2887](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2887)\n"

    "body": "I've seen there's a milestone for 4.0.0 set up and I would love to know the planned browser support. I've developed [Umbrella JS](http://umbrellajs.com/), a jquery alternative for fun and learning, and I would love to contribute to jquery some of the things that I learned.\n\nOne of jquery's main advantage and, in my opinion, handicaps is browser support since it makes the source code much bigger. While 3.0.0 Alpha was released in July 2015 and Beta just now in Jan 2016, **can I assume that version 4.0.0 wouldn't be ready for at least 1-2 years?**\n\nIf that is the case, seeing that [browser usage of IE10- halves every year](http://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop+mobile+tablet-browser_version_partially_combined-ww-monthly-201301-201601) and that [Microsoft dropped support for those browsers recently](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support), **I propose to make jQuery 4.x release support only IE11**.\n\nThis way a lot of modern features could be brought in and reduce greatly the browser-specific code and hacks. A simple example of the possible benefits can be seen in `.addClass()`. For modern browsers ([Umbrella JS](https://github.com/umbrellajs/umbrella/blob/master/src/plugins/addclass/addclass.js)) it can be reduced to this:\n\n``` js\nu.prototype.addClass = function(){\n\n  // Loop the combination of each node with each argument\n  return this.eacharg(arguments, function(el, name){\n\n    // Add the class using the native method\n    el.classList.add(name);\n  });\n};\n```\n\nWhile right now [in jquery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/a4d16a26abe3ea36337f7bfc4d1bfe13b893cd17/src/attributes/classes.js#L15) it has to be handled manually, avoiding repeating classes and such:\n\n``` js\naddClass: function( value ) {\n  var classes, elem, cur, curValue, clazz, j, finalValue,\n    i = 0;\n\n  if ( jQuery.isFunction( value ) ) {\n    return this.each( function( j ) {\n      jQuery( this ).addClass( value.call( this, j, getClass( this ) ) );\n    } );\n  }\n\n  if ( typeof value === \"string\" && value ) {\n    classes = value.match( rnotwhite ) || [];\n\n    while ( ( elem = this[ i++ ] ) ) {\n      curValue = getClass( elem );\n      cur = elem.nodeType === 1 &&\n        ( \" \" + curValue + \" \" ).replace( rclass, \" \" );\n\n      if ( cur ) {\n        j = 0;\n        while ( ( clazz = classes[ j++ ] ) ) {\n          if ( cur.indexOf( \" \" + clazz + \" \" ) < 0 ) {\n            cur += clazz + \" \";\n          }\n        }\n\n        // Only assign if different to avoid unneeded rendering.\n        finalValue = jQuery.trim( cur );\n        if ( curValue !== finalValue ) {\n          elem.setAttribute( \"class\", finalValue );\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  return this;\n},\n```\n"

But since `isHiddenWithinTree` does not yet perform exactly as advertised, _all_ disconnected elements are treated as hidden. In code, `jQuery( \"<div><a/></div>\" ).find( \"*\" ).addBack().toggle()` locks in inline `defaultDisplay` values for both elements, as does `$visible.detach().toggle().appendTo( inPageParent )`.\n\nThis is counterintuitive to me, _especially_ when it comes to element descendants like the above `<a/>`. I'd propose updating `isHiddenWithinTree` to use only inline display values when evaluating disconnected elements. Other possibilities include a) treating elements differently by parent (document or element vs. document fragment or null)\u2014please no, and b) keeping everything as-is. But no matter what, we should either add unit tests asserting the consensus decision, or document that disconnected elements are invalid context for the methods.\n"

You can see this illustrated here:\n\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/pjbg4398/\n\nWhen the context is passed explicitly, closest works as expected and only finds an element if it is within the context element.  However, if the jquery set has a context and closest is called without explicitly passing a context, no context is used (contradicting the documentation).  However, if the selector passed to closest contains non-css selectors (gt, eq, etc.), then the set's context **is** used.\n\nI believe the fix should be to change the loop condition as follows:\n\n>  for (cur = this[i]; cur && **cur !== context**; cur = cur.parentNode) {\n\nshould become:\n\n>  for (cur = this[i]; cur && **cur !== (context || this.context)**; cur = cur.parentNode) {\n\nwhich would be in line with the non-css code which does a similar thing with context:\n\n>  pos = rneedsContext.test(selectors) || typeof selectors !== \"string\" ? jQuery(selectors, **context || this.context**) : 0;\n"

If jQuery doesn't append `px` for you it's easier to fix by yourself than if it does append erroneously. My guess would be 99% of the uses are common properties like `(min-|max-|)(height|width)` or `top`, `left` etc. We could identify those most popular ones and append `px` only to them. Migrate could restore the previous behavior but warn if someone passes a numeric value to properties that are not on the current blacklist.\n"

    "body": "Hi\n\n**Scenario:**\n\nAn app is using requireJS for dependency management. Also its using a nonAMD jquery plugin that needs `jQuery` on window to work which it specifies as dependency in the requireJS config. The app has a tracking script (say crazyegg) installed too that loads its own jquery, but in noconflict mode.\n\n**Issue:**\n\nReduced testcase demo: http://plnkr.co/edit/6nxWaGnRHo6xRTiGQQBq?p=preview\n- The tracking script loads and executes. It registers \"jquery\" with requireJS but no `jQuery` or `$` on window is put as its in noconflict mode. All good.\n- requireJS loads our jquery plugin. But since it has a dependency on _jquery_, it tries to load _jquery_ first.\n- But requireJS already has a _jquery_ registered with it (which tracking script did) and so it does nothing. No additional jquery is loaded (which should have).\n- Now the plugin is loaded and since it expected `jQuery` on window and its not there, it breaks.\n\n**Solutions:**\n- `noConflict` method should also unregister _jquery_ in the AMD environment. Makes sense because noconflict is meant to remove any traces that the jquery library leaves on the website environment its loaded on.\n\nOR\n- Give another method for AMD noConflict which users can call separately.\n\nIf the jquery team agrees on either approach, I can take this issue up.\n"

There is no satisfactory answer and **I DO THINK THIS MAKES CODE BUG-PRONE** so I repost it here.\n\nI used to think `trigger(play)` just fires the native `play` function of audio, but today I just noticed that there is a slight difference between these two methods. If you register a callback for `play`, e.g. `$('audio').on('play', function() { console.log('playing'); })`, the callback will be invoked twice if you use `trigger(play)` but only once when using `play()`.\n- How come this discrepancy?\n- Is this as expected? I expect `trigger('play')` to behave exactly the same as `play`.\n- Is it possible to make `trigger(play)` only fires the `play callback` once, so as to keep potential bugs away?\n\n[[demo]](https://jsfiddle.net/Richard_Liu/gttde0p0/)\n\n---\n\nIn the demo, I call `trigger('play')` and `trigger('pause')` and then `play()` and `pause()`. The result is \n\n```\n// the following four lines are generated by trigger calls\nplay \nplay\npause\npause\n// the following two lines are generated by native calls\nplay\npause\n```\n\nThis demo could illustrate what I'm talking about.\n\nThis problem could be reproduced on:\n- Chrome version 46.0.2490.86 m\n- IE 11.0.9600.18053\n- FireFox 42.0\n\n---\n\nOne example problem is:\nI want to `addClass` on a button in the `playCallback` and `removeClass` in the `playingCallback`. When the audio is already playing,\n- If `audio.play()` is called, neither `playCallback` nor `playingCallback` will be invoked.\n- If `$audio.trigger('play')` is called, the `playCallback` will be invoked ONCE and the `playingCallback` is not invoked. This is an unexpected behavior.\n"

    "body": "If you try to do something like: `<input type=\"submit\" name=\"submit\">`\n(I see coders doing this all the time, they're unoriginal and can't think of a better name for a submit button than \"submit\" so bare with me, I think it would be good to address such users)\n\nThen when calling `myForm.trigger('submit')` for the form which contains this element, it will fail to submit in the same way which `myForm.submit()` fails since it will reference the element rather than the submit function of the form. I believe jQuery should add a check when dealing with \"submit\" to verify it's indeed a function before calling it. If not, you can still submit the form by grabbing a copy of the function by creating a new form dynamically, grabbing its submit method, then sending the form we want to submit through this function:\n`document.createElement('form').submit.call(myForm)`\nWe could also try to do something like `myForm.constructor.prototype.submit`... but then they might have an element named \"constructor\" in their form resulting in the same sort of issue. So I believe creating an element for it would be a good solution to grab the submit method and apply it to the function we wish to submit.\n"

This show-and-rehide measurement feature may be removed in a future version of jQuery.**\"\n\nLooking at the jQuery 1.11.3 source, I see no specific show/hide behaviour for `outerWidth()`.

This element is subsequently removed but the DOM is in an invalid state in the interim since `div` tags are not valid outside of the `body`. This is an issue for web crawlers using PhantomJS as the results of the html may be recorded before the element has been removed, resulting in broken html.\n\nWe are experiencing this issue with our single page app at https://househappy.org. When a crawler visits the site, PhantomJS loads the requested page and served the generated html to the crawler. To reproduce, spoof your user agent string to `Googlebot/2.1 (+http://www.googlebot.com/bot.html)` and visit the site. Using your browser's developer tools to inspect the DOM, you can see that all of the tags (`meta` et. al) that belong in the `head` are nested within the `body`. Looking at the source, we can see the culprit is a rogue `div` inserted after `html`. Using `MutationObserver` and `debugger`, I have pinpointed it to the `div` appended by jQuery.\n\nAppending it to the `body` will not maintain compatibility with all environments (in my tests, `body` doesn't always exist when this element is appended). Most crawlers allow you to blacklist elements by selector but I have not had luck in this case (`html > div` should work, but doesn't?). My suggestion is to add a discrete selector to this element to allow it to be easily blacklisted. I am thinking of submitting a PR to address this issue, using a data attribute as a selector (supported by PhantomJS as well as IE7+, avoids collisions with IDs / classes that may be in the wild).\n\nLet me know if you have any thoughts (or if this issue is even worth addressing).\n"

The following commits contribute to this change: 35f8e15fd73256ec02397d7bf93893e38afc9bc9 and b04b3861802606a114c936e753c0f20da6e8b236.\n\nCurrently, I'm relying on the `npm` published package for a module. As it stands right now, the distributed package cannot be re-built (module exclusion) as the various required files are being ignored \u2013 I'm looking to make `grunt custom:-deprecated,-effects,...` a `postinstall` hook. \n\nIt seems the current solution would be to include `jquery` as a `git submodule` and building, which _works_, it just feels a little dirty (...blame the package managers for this one. :wink:)\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that I'm bundling for the browser \u2013 so the exclusion of modules/file size has some effect.\n\nThanks!\n"

This is even though we now no longer load other test files than `basic.js` when testing the `basic` module. Perhaps there's a problem with source.\n\nWhen I joined the swarm with a local emulator running on x86 instead of the ARM emulator, it passed: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1654. But that doesn't help maintaining it.\n\nThere are lots of problems with Android 2.3 testing and apparently even just running basic tests is problematic. Restarting those jobs doesn't help, they just don't work with the BrowserStack Android 2.3 version. I'd prefer to just drop Android 2.3 completely in jQuery 3.0.0 but since no one else except @markelog thinks the same (well, except Mobile folks that are dropping it completely; am I right, @arschmitz?), how about we remove it from the periodic run and just add a note to the release process at https://github.com/jquery/jquery/wiki/Release-process that before a release one has to fire up a local Android 2.3 emulator & run basic tests?

    "body": "This is apparently an old issue, but there's a new wrinkle. Like others have reported on various sites (e.g. StackOverflow), they will occasionally get this JQuery error message:\n\n`Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. For more help, check http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/`\n\nIn my case, the offending code was in the JQuery 2.1.4 file:\n\n`xhr.open( options.type, options.url, options.async; options.username, options.password );`\n\nThe relevant information at http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/ states:\n\n`Developers must not pass false for the async argument when the JavaScript global environment is a document environment.`\n\nI could not find use of xhr.open in any of my own JQuery, so I looked in the JQuery source file itself. And there I found the source of the problem:\n\n`jQuery._evalUrl = function( url ) {\n    return jQuery.ajax({\n        url: url,\n        type: \"GET\",\n        dataType: \"script\",\n        async: false,\n        global: false,\n        \"throws\": true\n    });\n};`\n\nHaving `async` set to `false` triggers the console log error on my browsers. By changing it to `true`, the problem (i.e. the console error) disappears. Is there a reason why this is set to false when the specs say that doing so is now bad practice as the feature is being deprecated?\n"

And then I get back to IE8 and downgrading the JQuery version step by step, I started at 1.11.3, 1.11.2, 1.11.1 and then I stopped at 1.11.0, this is the most current version that the memory leak DOESNT exists.\n\nI haven't bump yet into any articles that has the same problem that I encountered, hope you can shed a light regarding this.\n\nThank you and more power to the JQuery team!\n"

If a user wants to know what classes fall under a selector I doubt they would be using it for duplicate entries.\n   \n   Alternatively, they could use $.unique() to remove duplicate entries.\n2.

For example: `jQuery.param({ foo: true, bar: false })` returns `'foo=true&bar=false'` (http://codepen.io/anon/pen/BoQXVg).\n\nIn most cases server side scripts don't have ability to check whether query variable was originally boolean or string and auto conversion to boolean turns both `'true'` and `'false'` to `true`. It would be great if `jQuery.param()` handles boolean properties like HTML checkbox element does: returns `on` or `1` if the state is `true` and `''` (empty string) if the state is `false`.

Depending on the length of text, you can end up with several thousand elements. This functions lightning-fast in Chrome and Firefox but IE stalls while trying to create the elements, when there are many of them. The problem isn't rendering the elements but the actual creation, as my demo will show. As, in all browsers, the two tests take comparable time per browser. \n\nAs the limit of the loop approaches 10,000, Edge is more likely to stall out, which is what I'm seeing a lot of in my website. At 1,000, it just takes a few seconds. At 2000, Edge takes 16 seconds in each of the two tests. Chrome and Firefox handily 10,000 in ~ four seconds.\n\nAfter more than five solid minutes of waiting on Edge for 10,000 passes, I closed the process where chrome did it in less than 5 seconds.\n\nThis is strange because Edge does many things much quicker than IE did.

I experienced no crashes with the test that writes to a jquery-created element, other than MS's browsers.\n\n(jsfiddle/v4 code)\n\n```\n$(document).ready(function () {\n   $(\"#clk\").click(function () {\n       StartTime = new Date().getTime();\n       var htm = $(\"<span>\")\n       for (var i=0; i<10000; i++) {\n           htm = $(\"<span>\").append(htm);\n       }\n       $(\"#recip\").html(htm);\n       EndTime = new Date().getTime();\n       TotalTime = EndTime - StartTime;\n       alert(TotalTime + \"ms\")\n   });\n\n   var $recip = $(\"<div>\");\n   $(\"#clk2\").click(function () {\n       StartTime = new Date().getTime();\n       var htm = $(\"<span>\")\n       for (var i=0; i<10000; i++) {\n           htm = $(\"<span>\").append(htm);\n       }\n       $recip.html(htm);\n       EndTime = new Date().getTime();\n       TotalTime = EndTime - StartTime;\n       alert(TotalTime + \"ms\")\n   });\n});\n```\n"

Jquery rounds the width. In most cases this is not any problem, but I noticed that sometimes, when the EL1 width is some particular fraction, jquery returns a number which results in EL2 rendeded one pixel off compared to  EL1.\n\nCan be jquery made that it returns floating point widths, as like the browser internally uses, in order to get consistent results all the time?

If one more more items are selected, then it returns an array. I would have expected that an empty array would have been returned in this case.\n\n[This fiddle shows the issue](http://jsfiddle.net/jzyyhosx/). IT appears all the way back to jQuery 1.2 where multiple value support was added.\n\nThe reason an empty array is not returned is the check for `elem.selectedIndex` being < 0 [here](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/attributes/val.js#L87). While I understand that for a single select, I don't while get why that would be done for a multi-select.\n\nRemoving `|| index < 0` would allow the empty array to be returned.\n\nHaving said that, I'm not really expecting this change to be made as I guess a number of sites will depend upon this behaviour. I'm more wondering if someone might be willing to say why it is done this way? I've searched this issue tracker and the bugs.jquery.com site, but couldn't find any mention of it.\n"

At the time the event arrives, the item has been removed and placed in a document fragment. Now jQuery tests the event selector on the document fragment and that fails of course.\n\nI guess the fix would simply be to check if the element tested on the selector actually has a attribute api?\n"

However, I can still:\n- change css properties of #a directly: `$(\"#a\").css()`\n- animate other elements: `$(\"#b\").animate()`\n\nUnfortunately, since this bug is not reproducible so I cannot provide a fiddle.

    "body": "### We're already not fully supporting Android 2.3\n\nThe hard truth is we've never fully supported Android 2.3. First of all, our unit tests don't pass there in a couple of modules: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/942. There are serious AJAX issues with error handling: #1786, #2458 (#2458 seems pretty serious, see https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2458#issuecomment-119572119), there are manipulation issues with checked radios: #1785.\n\nEven though most of the tests pass, we cheat a little by putting Android 2.3 in special paths in some of them:\n1. https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1c59b308d201d6dd0f0aed2ad0256d01b9f68047/test/unit/ajax.js#L1507-L1512\n2. https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1c59b308d201d6dd0f0aed2ad0256d01b9f68047/test/unit/event.js#L408-L413\n3. https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1c59b308d201d6dd0f0aed2ad0256d01b9f68047/test/unit/manipulation.js#L419-L426 & https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1c59b308d201d6dd0f0aed2ad0256d01b9f68047/test/unit/manipulation.js#L440-L444\n4. https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1c59b308d201d6dd0f0aed2ad0256d01b9f68047/test/unit/support.js#L236-L254\n### Maintenance cost\n\nThere are various problems that happen only on Android 2.3, e.g. now it turns out it doesn't allow unquoted reserved words as property names, exactly as our favorite IE8: #2478. It happens quite often that something just doesn't work, e.g. currently for some reason AJAX tests hang very near the beginning: http://swarm.jquery.org/result/479018. Surprisingly, it works on `compat`: http://swarm.jquery.org/result/479031. Lots of hours are being constantly put into making this browser work with our tests.\n### Market share\n\nWhen we released the last stable version of jQuery, 2.1 (I'm omitting patches) [a year and a half ago](http://blog.jquery.com/2014/01/24/jquery-1-11-and-2-1-released/), Android 2.3 still had a very large market share. Currently [Google stats](http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html) show it at 5.6% of all Android versions (this is not a mobile market share but Android market share). Real percentage might be a little higher as it's counted via Google Play Store but it's still not that large as it was back then.\n### Size\n\nCutting Android 2.3 support ([see an experimental branch that does it](https://github.com/mzgol/jquery/tree/no-android2.3)) saves 186 bytes gzipped, most of which are the `reliableMarginRight` support test and a workaround. Making all tests pass would add more.\n### Resolution?\n\nThere are a couple ways to solve the problem:\n1. Don't change anything, try to make Android 2.3 finally pass & continue to suffer.\n2. Drop support from `master` but keep it on `compat`; still suffer, although a little less (for some reason Android 2.3 problems happen more often on `master` than `compat`).\n3. Support Android 2.3 only partially - ensure it parses jQuery correctly, run a few basic tests ensuring most important APIs work on most common inputs. Don't care for perfect compliance: less suffering but such smoke testing may not be effective; also, it's hard to draw the line what's important and what's not.\n4. Drop support from both branches, redirect people still needing support to the 1.x & 2.x jQuery lines.\n\ncc @jquery/core @scottgonzalez @arschmitz\n"

Even if we made a request to another service. CORS was created exactly to prevent this kind of behavior in JSONP (arbitrary code execution).\n\nSo when we do $.get('http://weather.com/sf-weather') or like in Rails' jquery_ujs a form is being sent automatically, the attacker can respond us with text/javascript and execute arbitrary code on our origin.  Demo `$.get('http://sakurity.com/jqueryxss')`\n\nThe fix is to not execute responses from 3rd party origins by default and make it an option. Don't know who to cc to discuss it.\n\nP.S. I would switch it off for same origin either, because using subtle redirect_to saving tricks we can redirect user to local JSONP endpoint and still get an XSS but those are much more sophisticated vectors. \n"

This is on the developer.\n\n```\n$( \"ul.first\" )\n  .find( \".foo\" )\n    .css( \"background-color\", \"red\" )\n  .end()\n  .find( \".bar\" )\n    .css( \"background-color\", \"green\" );\n```\n\nIf we deprecate it in favor of `tap` (from Ruby) then inside a function we can query down however deep we need having the full assurance that when we come out of the function, we'll be right back where we started.  The language semantics enforce this and it clearly presents that one wishes to retain the original scope.\n\n```\n$( \"ul.first\" ).tap(function(){\n    this.find(\"foo\").css(\"background-color\", \"red\");\n}).find(\"bar\").css(\"background-color\", \"green\");\n\n//or for consistency...\n$( \"ul.first\" ).tap(function(){\n    this.find(\"foo\").css(\"background-color\", \"red\");\n}).tap(function(){\n    this.find(\"bar\").css(\"background-color\", \"green\");\n});\n```\n\n_The added noise of `function(){}` will go away when ES6 is realized._\n\n```\n$( \"ul.first\" )\n  .tap(el => el.find(\"foo\").css(\"background-color\", \"red\")).\n  .tap(el => el.find(\"bar\").css(\"background-color\", \"green\"));\n```\n\nWhether the function called by tap would pass the context in as `this` and\\or the first argument offers some room for discussion.  My examples assume it does both.\n\nWhere `end` tells us to return to the former scope after the fact (e.g. somewhere after the original `find`), `tap` tells us up front that we're going to want to maintain the scope.  To my way of thinking stating that earlier is better than later.\n\nIt also provides an opportunity for the use of higher-order functions which means a greater potential for reuse.  The `end` method offers no such opportunity.\n\n```\nfunction bg(selector, color){\n    return function(){\n        this.find(selector).css(\"background-color\", color);\n    }\n}\n\n$(\"ul.first\").\n    tap(bg(\"foo\", \"red\")).\n    tap(bg(\"bar\", \"green\"));\n```\n\nOr alternately, provide another version of `find`, `filter`, etc. (though I prefer `tap`):\n\n```\n$( \"ul.first\" ).find(\"foo\", function(){\n    this.css(\"background-color\", \"red\");\n}).find(\"bar\").css(\"background-color\", \"green\");\n```\n\nThe added benefit of `tap` is that we can easily see what's being returned from a function:\n\n```\nfunction spreadChristmasCheer(el){\n    return el.\n        tap(bg(\"foo\", \"red\")).\n        tap(bg(\"bar\", \"green\"));      \n}\n```\n\nSo now we can reuse such a function in a number of ways:\n\n```\nspreadChristmasCheer(el);\nel.tap(spreadChristmasCheer);\nel.find(\".christmas-tree\").tap(spreadChristmasCheer).find(\".presents\").remove();\n```\n"

This issue can be replicated for IE > 10.\n\nThere are three solutions which I came across, that allowed the application to run smoothly:\n\u2022 Keep the IE developer tool (F12) opened.\n\u2022 Uncheck option \u2018Disable script debugging in IE\u2019\n\u2022 Update the jQuery core library : jquery-1.11.0 at line 3857.\n        elem = elem.nodeType ? jQuery.cache[elem[jQuery.expando]] : elem[jQuery.expando];\n       with\n        elem = elem[jQuery.expando];\n\nWith the first two options, the error still persists(in console). But the dropdown are working properly.\n\nBut with the last solution , the error goes away totally.\n\nI have also tried updating the jQuery versions to 1.11.3 and 2.x, but nothing helped.\n\nPlease provide some technical assistance.\n\nRegards,\nKriti\n"

    "body": "See https://jsfiddle.net/mL8b3rvs/ (still exists in 2.1.4).\nThis is a similar problem as in #1823 except that it refers to the `Callbacks` API.\n\nWhen using the `Callbacks` API, a callback added with `add` that throws an error on `fire` breaks all subsequent `fire` calls (and remaining listeners in the 1st `fire` call are ignored, too). Maybe you could introduce an option to control the exception handling (e.g. \"onError: ignore|log|throw|throwCombined\").\nThe current behavior completely breaks the `Callbacks` object, so at least the call should be surrounded with try/catch to cleanup before rethrowing (`firing=false;`).\n"

    "body": "### Problem\n\nMy use case is to use `jquery` to page scrape from within `react-native` code.   I'm using [jsdom-jscore](https://github.com/brentvatne/jsdom-jscore) to build a document from downloaded html, then trying to pass that document to jquery to be able to parse it.\n\nMy code looks like:\n\n```\nvar jquery = require('jquery');\n     jsdom = require('jsdom-jscore');\n\nvar someHtmlIDownloaded = '<html><body><h1>Hello world</h1></body></html>';\n\njsdom.env(\n    someHtmlIDownloaded,\n    function (errors, window) {\n      var $ = jquery(window);\n      // do something with $ to parse/scrape html body.\n    }\n  );\n```\n\nThe `require('jquery')` throws an error:\n'document.createElement' is not defined\n\nThis occurs within sizzle, in the `assert(fn)` method.\n### Why it happens\n\n`react-native` creates its own global `document`, but `createElement` is not supported on this document object.   When `jquery` is loaded in this environment, because there is a global.document, it assumes document.createElement exists, and tries to attach itself to that document.  The check that passes can be found [here](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/66e1b6b8d49812239b5712d65922ff94c60f7b02/src/intro.js#L25) and looks like:\n\n``` javascript\nmodule.exports = global.document ?\n            factory( global, true ) :\n            function( w ) {\n                if ( !w.document ) {\n                    throw new Error( \"jQuery requires a window with a document\" );\n                }\n                return factory( w );\n            };\n```\n### Temp fix\n\nI was able to fix this locally by:\nBuilding jquery from source using command:\n`grunt custom: -ajax,-ajax/jsonp,-ajax/load,-ajax/parseJSON,-ajax/parseXML,-ajax/script,-ajax/var/nonce,-ajax/var/rquery,-ajax/xhr,-manipulation/_evalUrl,-event/ajax,-css,-css/addGetHookIf,-css/curCSS,-css/defaultDisplay,-css/hiddenVisibleSelectors,-css/support,-css/swap,-css/var/cssExpand,-css/var/getStyles,-css/var/isHidden,-css/var/rmargin,-css/var/rnumnonpx,-effects,-effects/Tween,-effects/animatedSelector,-dimensions,-offset,-deprecated,-event,-event/alias,-event/support,-wrap,-deferred,-core/ready`\n\nAltering the built jquery code to **never** assume there is a global document:\n\n``` javascript\nmodule.exports = function( w ) {\n                if ( !w.document ) {\n                    throw new Error( \"jQuery requires a window with a document\" );\n                }\n                return factory( w );\n            };\n```\n\nAnd I require that custom build js in my code:\n\n``` javascript\nvar jquery = require('dist/jquery.js');\n```\n\nAnd it works!\n### Actual Solution?\n\nWhat is the proper way to fix this?  Should we check if the `createElement` method exists on the `document` before deciding to pass it to the factory?\n"

See the following JSFiddle using Google Chrome or Safari for the minimal test-case:\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/42t3m7aa/12/\n\nHopefully the comments are pretty self-explanatory, but as you can see I have a basic CSS class called `.TitleCase` that will color text red. I generate a simple `div` with this class name and add it to the DOM via `append($([html markup here]))`. If I then try to append another DOM node containing that same class name to an `iframe`, it breaks styles from that class in the parent DOM (in other words, the style definitions disappear). There are a bunch of odd workarounds for this that seem to suggest this might be a bug with jQuery.\n\nWorkarounds:\n- Applying a `setTimeout` to delay the iframe manipulation\n- Giving the affected DOM element additional CSS class names or dummy attributes\n- Resorting to lowercase CSS class names\n- Manually removing and re-adding the class name to the DOM elements\n- Passing a string directly to `append()`\n- Using another non-jQuery method to generate the element and append it\n\nI suspect the problem lies in how jQuery's `append()` method treats HTML text VS a jQuery object, but i haven't been able to pinpoint exactly why from jQuery's source code.\n"

Nor will any other method under the [Tree Traversal category](https://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/tree-traversal/). And I do use this quite often so I suppose there might be a good use for having such feature... But I'm not sure how elegant it would be.\n\nJavascript does have a similar function to work around this, `compareDocumentPosition` (found thanks to the other answer on that SO question), but it's not as compatible as using the universal selector with `.index()`.\n\nI'm also pretty sure this isn't the best implementation for the need, but it works.

    "body": "There is some weird interplay between jQuery and standard `DOMContentLoaded` listener registration. This issue only manifests in Opera (only tested with 27.0.1689.76 on Mac). It does not appear to affect either stable or dev channels of: Safari, Chrome or Firefox.\n\njQuery itself doesn't need to be used at all, and in fact is not even used in the test case. Simply including jQuery in the page (at a specific point) causes the error. Removing jQuery fixes the issue.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Add a standard `DOMContentLoaded` listener that:\n   1. removes itself as event listener (https://gist.github.com/jasonkarns/f367c58149d9eda563bd#file-kill-domcontentloaded-js-L2)\n   2. appends an iframe (https://gist.github.com/jasonkarns/f367c58149d9eda563bd#file-kill-domcontentloaded-js-L3)\n2. include jQuery (jquery must be loaded _after_ the `DOMContentLoaded` listener per above)\n3. register any other `DOMContentLoaded` listeners. These listeners will never fire. These listeners can be registered before or after jQuery is loaded; it doesn't matter. As long as both jQuery and these listeners are loaded after the offending listener (no. 1 above) then they will fail to fire.\n\nMinimal test case uses [this gist](https://gist.github.com/jasonkarns/f367c58149d9eda563bd#file-kill-domcontentloaded-js) for the offending `DOMContentLoaded` listener (step 1 above). Then includes jQuery. Then uses the JS pane to register an additional `DOMContentLoaded` listener, which never fires.\n\nMinimal test case using jQuery 1.11.3 http://jsfiddle.net/1mmyx06b/11/\nMinimal test case using jQuery 2.1.4 http://jsfiddle.net/1mmyx06b/10/\n"

    "body": "The typical component, or \"require() what you need\", model is becoming not just familiar, but it feels like as it is on its way of becoming a standard.\n\nCurrent jQuery supports AMD and CommonJS. But what it lacks is the ability to be split. Let's say I know that the two jQuery plugins I need only require basic DOM manipulation (setting attributes) and eventing (click and keydown event). Then I would only need an approximately 1/10 of what jQuery offered.\n\nWhen looking into 2.1.4's `src/` folder, I noticed that `jquery.js` actually uses `define()` to load dependencies.\n\nMy question is: If I re-wrote this file to my liking and only loaded the modules I wanted, would that result in a smaller jQuery footprint? \n\nI am currently using [WebPack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) for my project, and already managed to bring Bootstrap down a couple KBs by excluding the features I did not want. Now I want to do the same to jQuery.\n\nEspecially with Bootstrap reduced, I realized that it also does not need the entire potential of jQuery. For instance, I see no where where Bootstrap would use the AJAX functionalities.\n\nKind regards, Ingwie.\n"

    "body": "Under ie9, when using a pseudo selector library (http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/viewport) jQuery executes the selector on every element on the page, even though it was given an id for the element.\n\n$('#id:in-viewport') causes :in-viewport to be executed on every element on the page\n$('#id').is(':in-viewport'); obviously does not.\n\nThis is a huge performance issue under IE9. This does not happen under chrome and likely under other browsers.\n\nI unfortunately do not have the expertise in jQuery to determine where exactly the issue lies so I cannot provide a patch at this moment. However, I would suspect that this would be a great performance optimization for older browsers where if the CSS selector is given an ID, it first searches by that instead of executing the pseudo selector code.\n\nI tested this in IE9, windows 7. Also tested in Chrome 42 on GNU/Linux (arch). jQuery version 1.11.2. \n\nYes I realize that I'm talking about a 3rd party add on for jQuery, I do not think it is the issue since the method defined for the :in-viewport ($.inviewport) is being called different numbers of times depending on browser version. In IE9, it gets called hundreds of times with elements that are not the one specified by ID. Under chrome it is just the element specified by ID. It appears to be how jQuery handles ID selectors.\n\nThe use case I have is a site with an infinite stream of items. I need to do something as the cards come into the viewport. I have a list of IDs for the cards so I iterate over the IDs and run the in-viewport pseudo selector on them. I have a list of 30 ids that gets pared down when each item has entered the view port. Under IE, performance was abysmal. running in-viewport 30 times shouldn't be too terrible, and indeed it isn't unless you're on IE9.\n"

    "body": "# Issue\n\nThis issue is present in both version 1 and 2 of jQuery.\n\nIt is happening on inline elements wrapping block elements, which is valid in HTML5, such as a header and an image wrapped in a single anchor.\n\nTwo issues arise:\n1. Different browsers report offsetWidth/Height of the anchor differently. For example Firefox would report one visible anchor in the example below, and Chrome will report 0. This also highly depends on the CSS styles applied, as on the page where this issue was discovered missing images are not displayed at all instead of the common missing image icon.\n2. While a browser may report an anchor as invisible, child elements are still visible and clickable as they inherit anchor properties.\n## Example\n\n``` html\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <script src=\"http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js\"></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <a href=#>\n        <h1>Header</h1>\n    </a>\n    <script>\n        $(function () {\n            alert('Visible anchors: ' + $('a:visible').length);\n        })\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n# Solution\n\nThere are 2 potential solutions that come to mind, but each has flaws\n1. Loop through child elements and check each for visibility. Potentially harmful for performance, although the selector is already marked as such in the documentation. \n2. Check parent for visibility. Probably not enough on its own, as it will report incorrectly, if anchor doesn't have visible children.\n"

Below is what the CSS looks like in my web inspector.\n\n```\n<div data-role=\"collapsibleset\" data-collapsed-icon=\"arrow-r\" data-expanded-icon=\"arrow-d\" data-mini=\"true\" style=\"margin:0; width:200px;\" class=\"ui-collapsible-set ui-group-theme-inherit ui-corner-all\">\n    <div data-role=\"collapsible\" data-inset=\"false\" class=\"ui-collapsible ui-collapsible-themed-content\"> \n        <h2>heading</h2>\n        <div class=\"ui-collapsible-content ui-body-inherit\" aria-hidden=\"false\">\n        \" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"\n        \" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0       \"\n            <ui data-role=\"list view\" class=\"ui-listview\">\n```\n\nI truly believe this has to be something I'm doing wrong or missing.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n"

I was trying to implement animated scroll with anchor links using animate(scrollTop) and the only thing that happened was the links broke completely. I found it strange as I was using previously functioning script (older version of jQuery) so I guess something broke in a recent update. The console shows no errors. I have tried many different versions of animated scroll so while I'm not 100% certain of my diagnosis I think I am in the right area. My coffeescript is something like this:\n\n```\n  $('a[href^=\"#\"]').on 'click', (e) ->\n    e.preventDefault()\n    target = @hash\n    $target = $(target)\n    $('html, body').stop().animate { 'scrollTop': $target.offset().top }, 900, 'swing', ->\n      window.location.hash = target\n      return\n    return\n```\n\nIt works fine when the css is either:\n\n```\nhtml, body {\n  overflow-x: hidden;\n}\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nhtml, body {\n  height: 100%;\n  width: 100%;\n}\n```\n\nbut not when they are combined like this:\n\n```\nhtml, body {\n  height: 100%;\n  width: 100%;\n  overflow-x: hidden;\n}\n```\n\nThis also happened when using 3rd party solutions [see here](https://github.com/kswedberg/jquery-smooth-scroll/issues/53).\n"

Then I posted [my question](https://forum.jquery.com/topic/the-behavior-of-handling-a-jquery-object) on jQuery Forum, still got nothing.)\n\nI noticed this paragraph in [jQuery's API doc](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#cloning-jquery-objects):\n\n> #### Cloning jQuery Objects\n> \n> When a jQuery object is passed to the `$()` function, a clone of the object is created. This new jQuery object references the same DOM elements as the initial one.\n\nThat means, if `$elem` is already a wrapped jQuery object, `$($elem)` will still unwrap-and-wrap the element(s) in `$elem` to create a new jQuery object, rather than returns `$elem` directly.\n\nInitially, my workmates and I supposed that jQuery needed to re-query the selector of `$elem` to keep up with the modified DOM. Then we tried these codes:\n\n``` js\n$wrapper.append('<p>test</p>')\nvar $elem = $('p')\n$wrapper.append('<p>test2</p>')\nvar $elem2 = $($elem)\n```\n\nWe found `$elem2` contained the same DOM element(s) as `$elem` did. That proved `$($elem)` didn't do any \"re-query\" thing.\n\nSo finally, we're confused about `$($elem)` -- why not return `$elem` directly when it's already a jQuery object. Any other purpose for creating (cloning) a new object?\n"

    "body": "I have an Backbone application where the models are being sync'd with the server.  When the backbone app makes requests to the API it needs to add an authorization token to the headers if the user is logged into the system.  This token allows the API to respond with data, if it is not present in a request it will respond with a 401.\n\nI have been debugging this for days with  Backbone and have deemed that it is a jQuery issue that I am facing.  The issue is that for two routes in my application ONLY IN SAFARI the authorization header is not being passed through to the API server from jQuery.  Backbone is in-fact sending it through to jQuery.\n\n```\nvar ajax = Backbone.ajax;\nBackbone.ajax = function() {\n    console.log('ajax: ' + JSON.stringify(arguments));\n    return ajax.apply(this, arguments);\n}\n```\n\nThis is the output\n\n```\n[Log] ajax: {\"0\":{\"type\":\"GET\",\"dataType\":\"json\",\"url\":\"http://jcrawford.heytix.com/guestlist/checkin/api/events/13044/guestlist/\",\"parse\":true,\"headers\":{\"Authorization\":\"Token 951ba59c833a80e4ddaf72ee6b3d9143\"},\"emulateHTTP\":false,\"emulateJSON\":false}} (backbone.sync.js, line 38)\n```\n\nI have also tried changing my .ajaxSetup to look like this to pass the headers through but this also did not give any different result when using Safari.\n\n```\n$.ajaxSetup({\n    headers: function() {\n        var token = '';\n        if(CheckinApp) {\n            var session = CheckinApp.getSession();\n            if(session) {\n                token = CheckinApp.getSession().getAuthorizationToken();\n            }\n        }\n        return {\n            \"Authorization\": \"Token \" + token\n        };\n    },\n    statusCode: {\n        401: function () {\n            CheckinApp.clearSession();\n            Backbone.history.navigate('#login', true);\n        }\n    }\n});\n```\n\nWhen it get's to my server however the header is not in place when I use Safari and only Safari.  This does not seem to happen when using Chrome or FireFox.\n\n```\n[Tue Apr 07 14:49:08.677473 2015] [:error] [pid 16743] [client 71.181.125.154:64016] <pre>Array\\n(\\n    \n[Host] => jcrawford.heytix.com\\n    \n[User-Agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_7_5) AppleWebKit/537.78.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/6.1.6 Safari/537.78.2\\n    \n[Accept] => application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01\\n    [\nReferer] => http://jcrawford.heytix.com/guestlist/\\n    \n[X-Requested-With] => XMLHttpRequest\\n    \n[Authorization] => Token 951ba59c833a80e4ddaf72ee6b3d9143\\n    \n[Accept-Language] => en-us\\n    [Accept-Encoding] => gzip, deflate\\n    \n[Cookie] => 'removed from output'    \n[Connection] => keep-alive\\n)\\n</pre>, referer: http://jcrawford.heytix.com/guestlist/\n\n[Tue Apr 07 14:49:12.027279 2015] [:error] [pid 16743] [client 71.181.125.154:64016] <pre>Array\\n(\\n    \n[Host] => jcrawford.heytix.com\\n    \n[User-Agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_7_5) AppleWebKit/537.78.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/6.1.6 Safari/537.78.2\\n    \n[Accept] => application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01\\n    \n[Referer] => http://jcrawford.heytix.com/guestlist/\\n    \n[Accept-Encoding] => gzip, deflate\\n    \n[X-Requested-With] => XMLHttpRequest\\n    \n[Accept-Language] => en-us\\n    \n[Cookie] => 'removed from output'\n[Connection] => keep-alive\\n)\\n</pre>, referer: http://jcrawford.heytix.com/guestlist/\n\n[Tue Apr 07 14:49:12.027565 2015] [:error] [pid 16743] [client 71.181.125.154:64016] HTTP 401 (GET /api/events/13044/guestlist), referer: http://jcrawford.heytix.com/guestlist/\n```\n\nAnd this is what I get with chrome and or firefox.\n\n```\n[Tue Apr 07 14:57:38.686859 2015] [:error] [pid 17630] [client 71.181.125.154:65109] <pre>Array\\n(\n[Host] => jcrawford.heytix.com\n[Connection] => keep-alive\n[Cache-Control] => max-age=0\n[Accept] => application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01\n[X-Requested-With] => XMLHttpRequest\n[User-Agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_7_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2272.104 Safari/537.36\n[Authorization] => Token 951ba59c833a80e4ddaf72ee6b3d9143\n[Referer] => http://jcrawford.heytix.com/guestlist/\n[Accept-Encoding] => gzip, deflate, sdch\n[Accept-Language] => en-US,en;q=0.8\n[Cookie] =>  'removed from output'\n)</pre>, referer: http://jcrawford.heytix.com/guestlist/\n\n\n[Tue Apr 07 14:57:44.001465 2015] [:error] [pid 17492] [client 71.181.125.154:65106] <pre>Array\\n(\\n    \n[Host] => jcrawford.heytix.com\\n    \n[Connection] => keep-alive\\n    \n[Accept] => application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01\\n    \n[X-Requested-With] => XMLHttpRequest\\n    \n[User-Agent] => Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_7_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2272.104 Safari/537.36\\n   \n[Authorization] => Token 951ba59c833a80e4ddaf72ee6b3d9143\\n    \n[Referer] => http://jcrawford.heytix.com/guestlist/\\n    \n[Accept-Encoding] => gzip, deflate, sdch\\n   \n[Accept-Language] => en-US,en;q=0.8\\n    \n[Cookie] => 'removed from output'\n)\\n</pre>, referer: http://jcrawford.heytix.com/guestlist/\n```\n\nAs you can see from the logging above the Authorization token is passed through with Firefox/Chrome BUT NOT with Safari for the second request.\n"

    "body": "Currently, if client-side code does `$.get(url, ...)` or `$.getJSON(url, ...)` and `url` is a cross-domain URL, by default JSON will look at the URL and the `Content-Type` of the response to guess what protocol to use.  Under certain conditions (e.g., the URL contains `=?` or `??`, or the `Content-Type` of the response is Javascript), jQuery will auto-guess that JSONP should be used and will automatically eval the response to the query.\n\nThis behavior is dangerous and can introduce XSS vulnerabilities.  It's also potentially unexpected: if the caller doesn't explicitly set `dataType` to `jsonp` or `script`, it might be surprising and unexpected that `get()`/`getJSON()`/`ajax()` can eval the response from the server.  At present, I can imagine it might cause subtle XSS vulnerabilities in deployed code that uses jQuery.\n\nI think it would be worth considering whether it's possible to change this automatic behavior.  A good principle might be: Don't eval the response from a cross-domain server unless the developer has requested that or could reasonably anticipate that it would happen.\n\nOf course, backwards compatibility with existing jQuery code is going to be a challenge.  I don't know whether there's a good way to \"thread the needle\" between (1) backwards compatibility with existing code and (2) creating traps for the unwary (where code that looks entirely reasonable is actually a XSS vulnerability).  But perhaps it's possible for jQuery to be just a bit smarter.  For instance, when the developer calls `$.getJSON()` and doesn't explicitly set `dataType` to `jsonp`, could jQuery use `JSON.parse()` instead of `eval`?  Is it feasible to disable the auto-JSONP or step back from it a bit, at least for cross-domain queries?  Lacking data on usage of jQuery APIs, I don't know what might be possible, but this smells like an area where some changes to jQuery's behavior might help developers avoid getting bit by subtle XSS bugs.\n\nSee e.g. http://stackoverflow.com/q/29044209/ and http://stackoverflow.com/q/29022794/ and all the usual resources about the security risks of eval on untrusted code.\n"

    "body": "Ok, this is a bit crazy and there are a few moving parts, but I'll try to give you what is happening as simply as I can. I have nginx running as localhost:8080 with CORS enabled. Separately, I have a django web app running on port 8000, serving the API. I use the CORS headers to access the API on the other port. Here's where things get weird:\n\nWhen the page loads, all of the scripts are re-requested by jQuery, which breaks a bunch of things. Here are a couple pics of my console for reference:\n![screen shot 2015-03-25 at 5 50 19 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/224680/6836368/9db32572-d317-11e4-906c-c70deee8a9e6.png)\n![screen shot 2015-03-25 at 5 50 33 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/224680/6836371/a376eff2-d317-11e4-9273-c1ed8b42571f.png)\n\nI've tracked it down here, on line 8549:\n\n```\n`// Cross domain only allowed if supported through XMLHttpRequest`\n`if ( support.cors || xhrSupported && !options.crossDomain ) {`\n```\n\nIt makes sense that the page would want to check to see if cors is enabled before trying to run again for all of the resources, but what I'm not understanding is why it's adding preflight if it is _NOT_ a crossDomain request? Isn't that the exact opposite of what we'd want? You'd want to add the preflight and other cors related request headers IF it's a cross domain request, not if it isn't. Perhaps this would be better:\n\n```\n    `if ( support.cors || xhrSupported && options.crossDomain ) {`\n```\n\nDoes that make sense? Please let me know if you have any questions; perhaps I can take you through my local server to illustrate what is happening. \n"

Consider a series of `<b>` elements, and a jQuery object, that contains _some_ of them:\n\n```\nvar $b = $('b:even');\n```\n\nThe [documentation](http://api.jquery.com/siblings/) on `$.siblings()` says:\n\n> The original element is not included among the siblings, which is important to remember when we wish to find all elements at a particular level of the DOM tree.\n\nSo the assumption is, that in this case `$b.siblings() == $('b:odd')`. However, jQuery does not test for each sibling, if it is contained in the original set, so we get:\n\n```\n$b.siblings() == $('b');\n```\n\nPersonally, I consider this a bug of the implementation of `$.siblings()`, but if it is intended behavior, at least the docs need to reflect this.\n"

    "body": "There is a timing bug in iOS8 that causes mobile Safari to incorrectly report a 'length' on objects that don't have one.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, this happens on iOS8+, possibly only on 64-bit systems.  The bug is triggered for objects that have only numeric properties.  For example:\n\n``` javascript\nfoo = { 1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c' } \n```\n\nIn this case, if you query `foo.length` then mobile Safari will _sometimes_ return 4 (the highest property + 1).\n\nThis causes functions like `$.each()` to treat objects such as foo above as arrays instead of objects, and when it tries to iterate them as such it fails since there is no foo[0].\n\nThe problem can be fixed in the function `isArrayLike()`.  Instead of just checking for \n\n``` javascript\ntypeof length === \"number\"\n```\n\nyou also need to check for\n\n``` javascript\nobj.hasOwnProperty('length')\n```\n\nThe latter check is immune to the iOS bug.\n\nI realize this is a fix just for one browser, but it's a browser with a very large user base.\n\nYou can see more background and some repro steps at the following Stack Overflow discussion:\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/28155841/misterious-failure-of-jquery-each-and-underscore-each-on-ios\n"

[jQuery also embraces npm](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/111475741445/publishing-your-jquery-plugin-to-npm-the-quick), which makes npm the future package manager for JavaScript of both front-end and backend.\n\nHowever, jQuery is quite heavy, bloated with methods that would probably never used by a website, and [this is not quite the npm way](https://github.com/substack/browserify-handbook#module-philosophy). Say if I want to iterate over objects, why would I use `jQuery.each` but not `lodash.each`? I can even load different versions of `lodash` methods in one app without `require`ing the whole lodash src files.\n\nTherefore, I'm asking: _Does it make sense to split this module into smaller ones so that developers can cherry pick the methods they are going to use?_ In fact, jQuery src is already modulised so it wouldn't be hard to publish each small piece to npm (just need a build tool to convert them). Packages like [cheerio](http://cheeriojs.github.io/cheerio/) is doing some similar things and jQuery could potentially share some small modules with it in some way. Angular.js could just use the ones they need instead of building jqlite themselves.\n\nJust like lodash, jQuery can also develop some build tool to build different versions for different purposes.\n"

    "title": "Performance of dimension methods significantly degraded on elements with style \"display: none\"",
    "created_at": "2015-02-24T15:55:50Z",
    "updated_at": "2018-06-20T00:51:29Z",
    "body": "When calling a dimension methd (namely any method from this page: http://api.jquery.com/category/dimensions/) against an element with style \"display: none\", the operation of the method is significantly slower than calls against elements without that property. I have been able to reproduce this behaviour in Firefox 35.0.1 on Linux Mint 17, Firefox 35.0.1 on Mac OSX Yosemite 10.10, and Chrome 40.0.2214.115 on Mac OSX Yosemite 10.10, using JQuery 2.1.0, 2.1.1 and 2.1.3.\n\nI have provided a demonstration here: http://jsfiddle.net/s3wocw4c/2/ This test performs 10000 calls for each dimension accessor against both a visible and hidden div, printing timing information to the console. Below is a sample output from my own machine:\n\n\"Visible width x10000: 523.7117869999993 milliseconds\"\n\"Hidden width x10000: 3993.656594000002 milliseconds\"\n\"Visible inner width x10000: 329.250270999999 milliseconds\"\n\"Hidden inner width x10000: 3206.354399 milliseconds\"\n\"Visible outer width x10000: 203.91570500000125 milliseconds\"\n\"Hidden outer width x10000: 3000.1816860000017 milliseconds\"\n\"Visible height x10000: 448.7823769999959 milliseconds\"\n\"Hidden height x10000: 3588.971694 milliseconds\"\n\"Visible inner height x10000: 402.9364519999981 milliseconds\"\n\"Hidden inner height x10000: 3882.8088529999986 milliseconds\"\n\"Visible outer height x10000: 250.1539499999999 milliseconds\"\n\"Hidden outer height x10000: 3624.321419 milliseconds\"\n\nThese indicate that dimension calls against hidden elements take 8-15x longer than those for visible elements.\n\nWhat led me to discover this issue was attempting to use the selectable interaction from the JQueryUI library to be able to select from 175 rows of a table. The selection is ordinarily responsive, but we also offer filtering on this table, implemented by hiding rows by setting the style to \"display: none\". As soon as filtering was applied, the selection became very unresponsive. I managed to identify that the slowdown was caused by the refresh function (defined at line 59 of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/selectable.js at time of writing), and managed to improve responsiveness by modifying the function to the following:\n\nthis.refresh = function() {\n    selectees = $(that.options.filter, that.element[0]);\n    selectees.addClass(\"ui-selectee\");\n    selectees.each(function() {\n        var $this = $(this),\n            pos = $this.offset(),\n            visible = $this.css(\"display\") != \"none\";\n        $.data(this, \"selectable-item\", {\n            element: this,\n            $element: $this,\n            left: pos.left,\n            top: pos.top,\n            right: pos.left + visible ? $this.outerWidth() : 0,\n            bottom: pos.top + visible ? $this.outerHeight() : 0,\n            startselected: false,\n            selected: $this.hasClass(\"ui-selected\"),\n            selecting: $this.hasClass(\"ui-selecting\"),\n            unselecting: $this.hasClass(\"ui-unselecting\")\n        });\n    });\n};\n\nBy bypassing the outerWidth() and outerHeight() calls against hidden elements, the responsiveness was on par with the unfiltered version.\n\nI was unable to find an existing issue that matched this problem, however I did find a Stack Overflow post which encountered the same problem while interacting with a different part of the JQueryUI API, posted three years ago: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9440664/jquery-ui-sortable-drag-initiation-is-slow-when-container-has-hidden-items This post also contains a link to a more featured benchmark for this particular problem than the demo I provided, albeit for an older version of JQuery: http://jsperf.com/outerwidth-on-hidden-visible-elements\n"

We also have internal uses in at least two libraries:\n- core\n  - defines `jQuery.expr[\":\"]` from `jQuery.expr.pseudos`\n  - defines :hidden, :visible, and :animated by extending `jQuery.expr.filters`\n  - calls `jQuery.expr.filters.hidden` in the :visible pseudo\n- UI\n  - defines :data, :focusable, :tabbable, and widget pseudos by extending `$.expr[ \":\" ]`\n  - replaces the :animated filter at `$.expr.filters.animated`\n  - calls `$.expr.filters.visible` and `$.expr.filters.hidden`\n\nSo now that this issue affects three source repositories and [jquery/api.jquery.com](https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com), here's the crux of it: can we standardize on one internally and deprecate the others? All things considered, my vote would be on `filters`.\n"

According to [the specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#dom-dataset), the key `nested-single` should be converted into `nestedSingle`, and `nested--double` should be converted into `nested-Double`.\n\nThe `.data()` method allows for no arguments to be provided, which the docs says should return all of the values as an object\n\n> Calling .data() with no parameters retrieves all of the values as a JavaScript object.\n\n**In jQuery 2.x**, this works correctly and `$(element).data()` matches `element.dataset` as one would expect.\n\n**In jQuery 1.x**, data attributes with two consecutive dashes (`--`) are converted the same way as data attributes containing a single dash. This means that `nested-single` and `nested--single` are treated in the same way, both being converted to `nestedSingle`.\n## Special notes\n\nIn 1.6 through 1.6.3, attributes containing two dashes in a row are not included in the returned object. This appeared to be fixed in https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/8e8fa6dc1ad514b0fa20e41faddcb85693d0408a, which makes 1.6.4 the first version where this bug appears in 1.x.\n## Tests\n\nHTML code used for testing\n\n``` html\n<div data-one=\"none\" data-nested-single=\"single\" data-nested--double=\"double\"></div>\n```\n\njQuery `.data` test\n\n``` js\nvar data = $('div').data();\n\nassert.equal(data['one'], 'none');\nassert.equal(data['nestedSingle'], 'single');\nassert.equal(data['nested-Double'], 'double');\n```\n\nThis will pass in 2.x, but fail in 1.x.\n\nHTML5 `dataset` test\n\n``` js\nvar data = $('div')[0].dataset;\n\nassert.equal(data['one'], 'none');\nassert.equal(data['nestedSingle'], 'single');\nassert.equal(data['nested-Double'], 'double');\n```\n\nThis passes, as expected.\n\n---\n\n/refs https://github.com/select2/select2/issues/2969\n/cc @loic\n"

The bug also occurs when using the [Karma test runner](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html) with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/), making our tests involving `blur` fail for versions of jQuery >= 1.8.3.\n#### Culprit\n\nI suspect the problem has something to do with [`event.js:567`](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L567). After clicking on the debug panel, the call to `this.blur()` does not trigger the event callback.\n"

(This one we can punt to another ticket.)\n\nA closer look at the `is` to `matchesSelector` stack:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/39191/5949796/8c5c35e4-a706-11e4-8ac3-da8d87530b3f.png)\n\nHere's the `a.rl` method we're looking at:\n\n``` js\na.rl = function(b) {\n            return b.qu.is(\":visible\") || b.Ts.is(\":visible\")\n        };\n```\n\nIn total, this stack from `a.rl` through `webKitMatchesSelector` accounts for a full 15% of all time on CPU (including JS, recalc, paint, etc) during this effect, so certainly not trivial.\n\nBut this still strikes me as odd in the first place.\n\nI don't think we would ever want a native qSA or matchesSelector to handle this sort of call, would we?\n"

This is basically what query.append() does. \n\nI think this is a Firefox bug and I have already filed a Mozilla bug report for it https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1114494\n\nHowever, as the issue may affect jQuery users I wanted to let know to possibly work around the issue or document the issue for your users.

I raise this issue here for two reasons:\n1) The BX Slider repo seems to be dead. 300 + issues. So I think any chances of getting a good fix in will be zero\n2) Although probably not caused by jQuery, I think jQuery could benefit from a bit of defensive coding in this case. \n\nOn occasion, when moving the slider quickly with and without multiple sliders on the page I encounter the following err:\n\n``` javascript\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'nodeType' of undefinedjquery.js:7160 \n    jQuery.fn.extend.addClassjquery.bxslider.js:779 (anonymous function)jquery.js:375 \n    jQuery.extend.eachjquery.js:139 jQuery.fn.jQuery.eachjquery.bxslider.js:779 \n    $.fn.bxSlider.updatePagerActivejquery.bxslider.js:1124 \n    $.fn.bxSlider.el.goToSlidejquery.bxslider.js:1207     \n    $.fn.bxSlider.el.goToPrevSlidejquery.bxslider.js:1052 \n    $.fn.bxSlider.onTouchEndjquery.js:4409 jQuery.event.dispatchjquery.js:4095 \njQuery.event.add.elemData.handle\n```\n\nOutside of the BX slider messing things up, things ultimately terminate in the [`classes.js` module](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/attributes/classes.js#L29)\n\nI tested a few things and changed `cur = elem.nodeType === 1 && ( elem.className...` to `cur = elem && elem.nodeType === 1 && ( elem.className...`. This kept the page from crashing and for all intents and purposes, my sliders worked as well. \n\nThis isnt a bug with jQuery, but something I think that would make the library better. \n\nI didn't see anything in the [`Contributing.md`](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) or the [Style Guide](http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/) about defensive coding. Are there any official opinions on defensive coding like this?\n"

Create a deferred\n2. resolve it using `resolveWith()`\n3. handle the promise in a `then`-handler and return any value\n4. attach another `then`-handler to the previous handler\n\nWhat I expect is that the `this` context in handlers of steps 3 and 4 are identical to the passed object in step 3. This only works if the value returned in step 3 isn't a jQuery-object. If a jQuery-object is returned in step 3, the `this`-context in step 4 is identical to the first argument received by the handler of step 4.\nThis issue is hard to explain and better demonstrated by a simple example:\n\n``` javascript\nvar d = $.Deferred();\nd.promise().then(function() {\n  console.log(\"1\", this);\n  // 1 Object { hello=\"world\"}\n  return \"test\";\n}).then(function() {\n  console.log(\"2\", this);\n  // 2 Object { hello=\"world\"}\n  return $();\n}).then(function() {\n  console.log(\"3\", this);\n  // Expected:\n  // 3 Object { hello=\"world\"}\n  // Got:\n  // 3 jQuery ( )\n});\nd.resolveWith({\"hello\": \"world\"});\n```\n\njQuery-version: 1.11.0\n"

    "body": "Please note: I'm currently only testing in Chrome.  It's the only browser that I've been successful in implementing this project (so far).  From what I can tell this seems to be due to incomplete / conflicting SVG implementations across browsers.\n\nI'm not 100% sure if this issue is (at its core) an issue in how jquery-ui handles dropped elements, or if my proposed fix (below) for jquery is appropriate.\n\nIn my project, the user can drag and drop svg 'path' elements onto an 'svg' element.  The caveat is, for UI design purposes, I'm not technically dragging the actual element on to the 'svg' element.  I'm dragging an 'image' of the svg path element, and then when it's dropped onto the 'svg' element I run an ajax callback (tested synchronous and asynchronous) to retrieve and render the actual 'path' element.  When this is done (using v2.1.1, and jquery-ui v1.11.2) it appears jquery-ui is calling \"_setPositionRelative\" when it's in the process of creating the element being dropped, which in turn calls jquery \"css\".\n\nThis is the error I'm getting:\n\n```\n  Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'getComputedStyle' of null jquery.js:5517\n```\n\nNow, when I look at which property the \"css\" function is querying [\"position\"], this property exists in the 'path' element that I'm dropping onto the 'svg' element, but apparently it doesn't exist when this \"_setPositionRelative\" function is called.   Not that I'm assigning the 'position' property manually on the element.  When querying a RENDERED 'path' element, all the css-related functions seem to generate appropriate values.\n\nFor my purposes, I found a single location that I thought it would be appropriate to use a try / catch block.  This seems to prevent issues when trying to retrieve css properties on elements that don't yet exist.  Specifically in the context of the drag / drop scenario summarized above:\n\n```\n/*\n added try / catch in jquery.js around LINE 5993\n*/\n\n// Otherwise, if a way to get the computed value exists, use that\nif ( val === undefined ) {\n    try{\n        val = curCSS( elem, name, styles );\n    }catch(e){}\n}\n```\n\nThis fixes my issue for the time being.  For reference here is a complete stack-trace.\n\n```\n getStyles jquery.js:5517\n curCSS jquery.js:5526\n jQuery.extend.css jquery.js:5993\n (anonymous function) jquery.js:6099\n jQuery.access jquery.js:3490\n jQuery.fn.extend.css jquery.js:6081\n $.widget._setPositionRelative jquery-ui.js:6198\n (anonymous function) jquery-ui.js:415\n $.widget._create jquery-ui.js:5877\n (anonymous function) jquery-ui.js:415\n $.Widget._createWidget jquery-ui.js:584\n $.(anonymous function).(anonymous function) jquery-ui.js:376\n (anonymous function) jquery-ui.js:530\n jQuery.extend.each jquery.js:375\n jQuery.fn.jQuery.each jquery.js:139\n $.fn.(anonymous function) jquery-ui.js:522\n bootstrapPath path.js:6\n $.ajax.success VM2831:124\n fire jquery.js:3073\n self.fireWith jquery.js:3185\n done jquery.js:8251\n (anonymous function) jquery.js:8598\n```\n"

    "body": "Sometimes it can't be avoided to have a browser handle HTML as XHTML. It seems that there is no reason jQuery shouldn't be able to handle namespaced XHTML markup, since the only difference in the (DOM) interface is the namespace itself.\n\nThe problem is that jQuery can't find nodes in an XHTML document via calls to `getElementsByTagName` and the bootstrapping/feature detection code, as well as code for handling generated elements fails with calls to `createElement`. The `NS` variants need to be used in the case of XHTML in order for the elements to be imbued with the correct DOM extensions (`HTMLElement`, CSS etc.).\n\nI understand that there is a [won't fix](http://contribute.jquery.org/wont-fix/) section in the guidelines that references bug [#13092](http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13092). Again, unless you know something I don't, the only (DOM) difference between markup that comes through as `application/[xhtml+]xml` and `text/html` is the need to specify a namespace. At least that's my feeling through many, many years of osmosis.\n\nThe fix more or less reduces to detecting the XHTML namespace in the document on load, and replacing calls to `getElementsByTagName` and `createElement` with `getElementsByTagNameNS` and `createElementNS`. Testing the fix will almost certainly take more effort than the fix itself.\n\nThis is something I'm fully prepared to take on (and preliminary tests are positive). I'd rather fix a few lines in jQuery than overhaul an entire infrastructure. I'm posting this issue here to see what the general sentiment is and glean some historical information.\n"

The textbox is wired with a keyup event handler that checks if the input is numeric using a Regex and clears any non-numeric characters. The textbox is also wired to a focus event handler to check if the value of the select element is numeric and if it's not then blur the textbox. Basically, the functionality is to enter phone numbers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe problem is that in IE11, non-numeric characters go through whereas is Chrome and Firefox the non-numeric characters are deleted as expected. Not sure if it's a jQuery or an IE11 problem.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe jsFiddle is here: <a class=\"ext-link\" href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/R2Axp/2/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span class=\"icon\">&nbsp;</span>http://jsfiddle.net/R2Axp/2/</a> \n</p><p>Issue reported for jQuery 1.10.2</p>\n"

Our code base is quite large and there are thousands of references to these types of methods that accept an HTML string for DOM insertion, so it's not feasible to replace each instance with our own method call. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs far as I can tell, there's no current way to intercept HTML strings before insertion. What I'm suggesting is adding some kind of extension point to jQuery Core that would allow someone to register a function that would receive the HTML before insertion and allow someone to change that HTML that would actually be inserted. This has the following potential uses:\n</p>\n\n<ul><li>custom XSS filters\n</li><li>auto linking filters (automatically turn an email address into a link, for example)\n</li><li>stripping out personal data\n</li></ul><p>\nJust to be clear, I'm not suggesting including anything other than an extension point that would allow such filters to be written.

Crowder <tj@\u2026> at: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12213\n\n<p>\nJust as jQuery itself needs to know when an element is cleaned up, plug-in code (and perhaps application/page code) sometimes needs this notification as well. The TinyMCE jQuery plug-in, for instance, monkey-patches jQuery to hook into <tt>empty</tt>, <tt>remove</tt>, etc. so it can clean up after itself. I was just doing a plug-in where each instance needs to respond to window resize, and try as I might, I can't come up with a way to do it that won't leave handler(s) lying around if the programmer using it doesn't call my \"destroy\" method -- and let's face it, that's pretty easy to fail to do.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRecommend adding a hook or event that plug-ins (and application/page code) can use, with the clearly-documented caveat that almost <em>any</em> other option should be used first because of the potential performance implications.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe performance cost in the normal case (when no one has hooked the event) looks trivially small: Looking at <tt>cleanData</tt> in the current dev source, it looks like it comes down to one extra property test just after <a class=\"ext-link\" href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/9ecdb2472be7661477564e46bce51432d4a5a84e/src/manipulation.js#L742\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span class=\"icon\">&nbsp;</span>line 742 in manipulation.js</a> (that line number will rot), e.g.:\n</p>\n\n<pre class=\"wiki\">742: if ( data &amp;&amp; data.events ) {\nNew:   if ( data.events.destroy) {\nNew:     jQuery(elem).trigger(\"destroy\"); // Or a more efficient way, of course\nNew:   }\n</pre><p>\n...which is pretty cheap. A quick test on my 2.4GHz machine with Firefox on 10,000 elements, 5,000 of which had <tt>data.events</tt> and one of which had <tt>data.events.destroy</tt>, the average time to clear the container was 124-126ms both with and without the above. The cost when someone has actually hooked the event, of course, will be higher but largely irrelevant; if they've hooked it, presumably they have a reason.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis would, of course, be a somewhat unusual event. My off-the-cuff is that it wouldn't bubble, and couldn't be cancelled. But there are other unusual events. :-)\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI'm happy to get into the details of this and submit a pull request (with tests and documentation) if this suggestion has legs.\n</p><p>Issue reported for jQuery 1.8rc1</p>\n"

What if I want to respond to something when I get headers back? What if I want to know when I start receiving content back from the server?\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAn excellent example of this is using jQuery for bandwidth testing. Without a way to detect when I initially receive content back from the server (not just beforeSend), I will also include any delay spent waiting for the server to respond.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI've added support for the RECEIVE_HEADER and LOADING event as per the XMLHttpRequest specs in <a class=\"ext-link\" href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/438/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span class=\"icon\">&nbsp;</span>this pull request</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI would also like to see support for onreadystatechange as well since those are valuable states that we are only limiting ourselves and losing value by not tracking.\n</p><p>Issue reported for jQuery git</p>\n"

For example if you have 3 items that are width 33% inside of a 100px element we're returning 33px for each element. Theoretically an animation method might be able to return a more interesting result if they know that there are extra fractional-numbers getting rounded off.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI got a report on this directly from Mozilla but I agree with them that this particular change makes it hard to get to good numbers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSee also: <a class=\"closed ticket\" href=\"http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/3239\" title=\"bug: innerHeight/outerHeight does not round up (closed: fixed)\">#3239</a>.\n</p><p>Issue reported for jQuery 1.6.1</p>\n"

That test case uses the latest 2.x version of jQuery. We see the same behavior in [this test case](http://jsfiddle.net/1zmo8ong/4/) using the latest 1.x version of jQuery. Following the version backwards we can see the following:\n\n[Version 1.8.3 test case](http://jsfiddle.net/1zmo8ong/3/) -- neither of the html calls write anything to the elements.\n[Version 1.9.1(and all future versions) test case](http://jsfiddle.net/1zmo8ong/5/) -- calling html with true writes true to the element while calling with false writes nothing.\n\nWhile this is not a serious issue, it would be preferable for the html method to act the same for both boolean values. While the 1.8.3 behavior wrote nothing, it was at least consistent for both true and false. It seems to me that html should either go back to writing nothing in both cases or writing \"true\" for true(as it does now) and \"false\" for false.\n\nThis behavior was tested on Chome 37.0.2062.124, Safari 7.0.6 (9537.78.2), and Firefox 32.0.3 and identical behavior was seen in all three browsers.\n"

    "body": "### Problem / Issue\n\nThere's a known issue with IE8 and HTML5, that when it clones/adds a *non-standard* element to the page, it adds a blank prefix to the tag (and includes the colon).  \n_Note: \"non-standard\" is not exactly correct, there are standard, less common elements that this also happens to._\n\njQuery is not selecting those blank-prefixed elements when there's a multi-stage (combo) selector.  It works with `find()` and using the tagname without the prefix, but not when using a selector pattern like `$('<ancestor> <descendant>');`.  Refer to the example below, for a clearer understanding.\n\n_Affected Browsers: I only know this applies to IE8.  I'm doubtful that it applies to other versions of IE, but I'm not able to test._\n\n---\n### Update\n\nMy statement above isn't exactly correct; `.find()` doesn't necessarily solve the issue.  You'll notice inconsistent behavior when you use pseudo-selectors, such as `:visible`.  The demo shows that the IE8 bug (prefixed colon) is not handled using jQuery, and using pseudo-selectors should at least be consistent with selecting by element tagname (whether it includes the prefixed elements, or not).  That is `$('some-element');` and `$('some-element:visible');` should return the same results, if there are no hidden `some-element`.\n\nThe behavior I found in IE8 is that `$('some-element:visible')` acts like `$('some-element:visible,\\\\:some-element:visible')`.  What I'm after is something to patch the IE prefix bug so that `$('some-element')` acts like `$('some-element,\\\\:some-element')`.\n\n---\n### Demo / Test Case\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/vol7ron/9sverLdu/\nhttp://fiddle.jshell.net/vol7ron/9sverLdu/show/  (for IE8 testing)\n\n```\n<some-element>\n    <span>foo</span>\n</some-element>\n\n\n\n<script>\n    // Add custom element to DOM for IE8\n    document.createElement('some-element');\n\n\n    jQuery(document).ready(function ($) {\n        var $el = $('some-element');\n        var $clone = $el.clone();\n\n        // create a copy of the element after the original\n        // IE8 should create an element with a blank prefix <:some-element>...</:some-element>\n        $el.after($clone);\n\n        // method 1\n        outputLength( \n            \"$('some-element span').length\", \n            $('some-element span') \n        );\n\n        // method 2\n        outputLength( \n            \"$('some-element').find('span').length\", \n            $('some-element').find('span') \n        );\n\n        // method 3\n        outputLength( \n            \"$('some-element span, \\\\\\\\:some-element span').length\", \n            $('some-element span, \\\\:some-element span') \n        );\n\n\n        // method 4\n        outputLength( \n            \"$('some-element:visible span').length\", \n            $('some-element:visible span') \n        );\n\n    });\n\n    function outputLength(_label, _elems){\n        var $label  = jQuery('<label />').html(_label + ' : ');\n        var $value  = jQuery('<span  />').html(_elems.length);\n        var $output = jQuery('<div />').append($label,$value);\n        jQuery('body').append($output);\n        console.log($output.html(), _elems);  // incase you prefer console\n    }\n</script>\n```\n"
