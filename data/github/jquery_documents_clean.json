adds one handler per event type takes care call user handlers manually way supported old ie becoming plausible add native handler every user handler let browser work keep track larger plans roadmap thanks question go ahead close since bug feature request feel free continue discussion hi timmywil thanks much reply expecting one soon also mind closing issue since elegant response answers main points concern however looking contributors graph observe trends today years later obvious drop occurred take last year see total commits covering period additions deletions comparing likes angular react vuejs paints pretty telling picture course know numbers everything think project size commits year single blog post much community interest support maybe reveals community nt see staple web okay maybe right focus library cares essential removes left cruft ajax animations etc syntax lovely maybe place redefined jquery likes angularreactvue cheers thanks informative reply projects mentioned much larger scope jquery core nt really worth comparing certainly drop number commits believe still strong competent team fairly active community irc gitter angular react similar projects gained wide usage us story quite worldwide words think definitely truth saying jquery nt going anywhere long jquery still used vast majority web sites opposed web apps including top million sites traffic according builtwith many web apps part crawlable web builtwith monitors many big frameworks focusing jquery people think majority feedback get changes compatible previous versions regardless whether previous behavior documented long way saying people nt fond changes think mistake someone building angular vue etc use dom manipulation jquery common use pull domstateful plugins defeat reason using frameworks first place communities building widgets work properly framework instead gt jquery people think reason made issue due lack communicationactivity roadmap going forward regards jquery modern

time jobs terms jquery release thinking end year dotnetshadow yep thinking least getting beta end year many things jquery made much easier back nt framesworks jquery nt framework compare angular dying react vue silly angular jqlite built projects worked added jquery since react newer versions angular work dom completely different used super handy use jquery selectors rarely use selectors anymore need use easy standard javascript ajax used another popular area jquery came handy promises newer versions javascript nice clean easy way ajax calls promises built using fetch promises newer javascript versions need use jquery babel also popular typescript allow us cross browser compatible something jquery really used help seeing comparisons frameworks makes wonder informed javascript general comparing jquery react like comparing comparing bicycle sports car issue jquery dropping continue drop popularity simply javascript gotten lot easier work frameworks might also reason jquery nt used much simply frameworks lot built functionality combined newer versions javascript yet see benefit using jquery woah hold yoar hoarses bruvas jquery rawks like nun ok enough alphabet riddles mean jquery still currently highly relevant far building customized kickass spas function like standalone software web pages jquery cloud joy last years reason able code less design dealt javascript good ol days netscape ie wars grey hair lol long time ago times would design applications flash actionscript dhtml remember web pages back becoming dynamic less boring besides orgasmic headaches crossbrowser compatibility lol code base long wayyyy tooo lengthhhhyyyy much much later surpriiiise jquery arrives goal boldly go coder gone talk success jquery among awesome things introduces less code normalization bingo javascript library removed headaches crossbrowser compatibility relevancy jquery today equals facility designing code major reason adopt jquery stay closest native code without constraints frameworks emphasize allows customize ux way imaginable absolutely necessary designing prototypes another major reason jquery usage coding interpreter legible understandable hence intuitive explaining code within code bright let minifiers assorted cleaners job prepping file production one may gather modern browsers offer pretty much latest javascript jquery becoming redundant far crossbrowser compatibility issues jquery offers much foresee future jquery align sturdy crossbrowserness priorities userfriendly library possible allows among things novel quickest element manipulation traversing many frontend designers like want delve interactive spa coding web pages may full knowledge javascript none simply want design visions code effortlessly without steep learning curves constraints short shelf life frameworks respect jquery way less overwhelming designer needs expert programmer learning using jquery jquery remains relevant us folks awesome spas prototypes take

onerror event scripts relatively recent supported everywhere avoid silent failures script errors grabbed source evaled dmethvin tested test case nt work ie works ie also works ios support unfortunately also nt work android browser fortunately android browser nt seem support csp perhaps work extend crossdomain way loading scripts modern browsers sure check though android browser

security policy directive scriptsrc self error produced line jqueryminjs script file content line function e n var ttr createelement script way around problem without use unsafeinline looking internet desperate solution tried brian suggested avail hi aimeekatherine following comments assume dynamically generating script tags issue related could try adding hash script csp although nt something tested dynamically generated script tags tested attributes tag stripped alternatively patched work dynamically generated tags work fine tag generated using jquery nonce possibly hash applied comments nt help example creating script tags test case would help immensely mgol technical note finally fully discontinued microsoft midjanuary might make sense still aim compat browsers anymore pomax applies ie said jquery would nt gain lot size cutting ie amp support even cutting ie support brought size decrease eliminated whole alternative event model amp lot quirks apart size good motivation dropping support would issue hard fix maintaining ie lt support might drop ie lt one day since js frameworks amp nonui libraries still support ie nt think ones cut support first ui libraries like jquery ui dropping ie lt lot since want rely flexbox concern jquery core amazingly weird graceperiod still thanks windows server crazy bit trivia functional data changes anything planned browser version support still supported atms graingert source information official microsoft ie support policy document claims ie lt nt supported anywhere anymore edit longer relevant comment used say ie woops thinking hi

load plain tag without need integrity crossorigin attributes receiving mentioned reply email directly view github mute thread pomax problem problem jquery function adds script dom without taking previously existing attributes account btw workaround one might use losing nonce attribute probably problem associated might usecases nonjavascript default attribute omitted elements replaced eg webgl landed another pr make solving pretty much oneliner pr originally addressed needs updating see timmywil nice understand correctly pr handle nonce attribute attributes mentioned cnsgithub sorry specific attributes mean must glazing comment timmywil said attributes like eg webgl okay saw mention nt see mentions attributes scope issue csp addressed note already covered nt think necessary using

supposed give computed css properties hence name css width css height give bounding box instead breaking change messing user base huge gotcha add another point regarding relationship note always return content width regardless value css property avoid penalty use rather documented behavior checked still valid jquery think valid points far resolving problem conflicting concerns mention width applies height well previous use flaky property part documented standard return fractional pixels subpixel rendering becoming common finding cases got things wrong switched historically jquery users seen shorthand although definitely cases past versions true ideally like find solution breaks least code possible since changing results existing apis would great could find way migrate identify andor fix holgerjeromin getfree would like apis return let start think existing code might break way see essential reliable way getting dimensions position element matter element ancestor csstransformed consider example jquery jquery blue box wants exactly red box since body element transformed boundingbox coordinates good general moment apply csstransformations calculation based elements dimensions going give wrong result even seemingly harmless transformations like cause problems jquery already offset position give boundingbox coordinates iirc ok jquery introducing breaking changes long way getting true element dimensions boundingbox dimensions needed given wo nt needed often could alternate way getting width height position provide fractional pixels expense useless transformations applied ok jquery introducing breaking changes long way getting true element dimensions boundingbox dimensions needed exactly application needs way get dimension based information correct positioning complex transformed elements minimal example non fractional value disadvantage result complete bogus transforming hmm maybe need use cases want dimensions transforms applied let start summary documented surface area using horizontal dimension without loss generality returns computed css width property include exclude padding borders per css boxsizing property returns computed content width may less boxsizing borderbox equal boxsizing contentbox returns computed padding box width sum computed left right padding returns computed border box width sum computed left right borders equal boxsizing borderbox returns computed margin box width sum computed left right margins capable returning fractional values closely tied css box model especially since also transforms fact non methods probably convenient means getting untransformed dimensions although starting scratch might want condense together would definitely consistent naming ticket though agree holgerjeromin use values calls

questions asked jquery browser api matter answer see related handling computedresolved value apis supposed answer question nt take transforms account transforms influencing final dimensions element screen computed value agree current behavior buggy set new value element apis answer question makes sense jquery side method serves getter setter apis respond set particular width generally get one getter btw agree current behavior getter takes transforms account buggy element displayed dimensions screen question element displayed screen include transforms hand since single property takes things account api nt setter equivalent clear exactly would setting jquery side responsibility api although getter less behaves way ignore boxsizing browser apis evolving way satisfy conditions api get displayed size element without taking transitions account asking something like kind weird time people asking question really asking value computed width displayed width minus transforms afaik browser api would answer question well treated obsolete web compatibility reason nt take transforms account well returns decimal values hope got paragraph right love someone working browser confirmdeny though bzbarsky last point problem method would fine getter final displayed size element also serves setter us undermines purpose nt make easier also methods serve getters setters fact apis setters well actually terrible need know value style write triggers style read means apis layout thrashing builtin think bad apis like want leave getters setters seems converted fulfill first two use cases suggested nt jquery api return dimensions element screen api returning position element screen new api former tried removing width amp height hooks css saving bytes gzipped process got test failures dimensions module css module failing tests ones checking disconnected node negative values means though switching amp doable also think ca nt switch back would break jquery contract nt cut fractional values besides really like avoid going back fractional values sure anything going back moment using retrieve api take transforms account purpose john resig wrote ago api awesome saves code complexity amp size well gives speed boost nt see us going back previous implementation would hurt much fronts still think many people want current behavior going back previous one would hurt well problem serves setter well makes nonsymmetrical api nt really know seems like mgol explained challenges pretty well api retrieves actual transformed dimension position single number taking several css properties account ca nt used getter setter roundtrip single number consider regressions even changes existing behavior better compatibility still may play release love someone working browser confirmdeny browsers returning used width css terms everything except nonreplaced inlines layout width ignoring transforms think calling displayed size element without taking transitions account api already

like return nontransformed values might something sane nonreplaced inlines note integeronly browsers getcomputedstyle width returning used width css terms everything except nonreplaced inlines layout

reason resurrected week wordpress update wordpress themes impacted appears autoupdate themes come light last year even right release could done something different let revisit change better people update themes goingforward question wordpress ever update jquery right wp includes migrate order let themes sloppy upgrade jquery themes would need able run jquery without migrate combination would allow work given uproar changing invalid undocumented thing like unquoted attributes worry something substantial fare seems like main problem wordpress themes either updated users theme update available either makes jquery update risky sure deal never updating jquery could stop autoupdating jquery let theme builders decide version jquery use always revert release thing major saying saying option seems main problem jquery throws error caught makes scripts page stop working jquery historically treating wrong inputs noop returning empty list instead throwing assumed consumers implicit

considered one mentioned clear wp path jquery right anyway one smaller problems could stop autoupdating jquery let theme builders decide version jquery use trickier understand wordpress default always

ppl actually buying nt mean use default browser fact looks like primary clientele opera mini looking much lower percentage plus market share dropped four months extrapolated data assume tendency another four months share go lower standart pretty big argument removal consider android add numbers ios ms browsers would tiny like really tiny add desktop browsers share would practically nonexistent mzgol ppl core spend lot lots time working supporting browser job pretty unrewarding hella annoying whereas still nowhere near green trunk meanwhile users field bugs ever giving even smoke testing seems really necessary also concerned cases regressing android would mean worse experience others fully supporting browser could eg mean revert would pretty sad would cause issues discussing

smoke testing though keeping existing tests except maybe ones currently failing small set tests checking basic api behavior would mean keeping existing tests nt think making android support officially would buy us much something like library use handful simple operations backed required modules explicitly avoiding edge cases support would allowed degrade point core functionality fails nt think would buy people much guess code web relies least couple edge cases api would nt oppose much though maintaining nt lot trouble except time needed choosing proper tests initially right acting

phantomjs since share dumb limits yet sort weakened android support suggests might work document places punted hard involved degrading support newer popular browsers dmethvin dropping android support

bytes gzipped test workaround mostly maintenance cost might notice usually one fight stupid browser p fact never passed whole test suite various workarounds tests browser less behaves broken nt issues android require workarounds source able pass test suite unable make android also trying fully supporting browser could mean reverting useful changes like decided adding support nonbrowser environments

also force layout dirty time easily trackable classes docs warn well talks strongly recommend visible hidden selectors great wikipedia new visual editor tremendous amount app slowness directly attributable using baaad anyway moving native method throws exception try parsing see case obviously invalid selectors better even go patch bouncing exception follow total time column end

roots across board well okay elaborate actually makes difference two arguments passed one shadow root nt example elem shadow root agree would affect lot different methods especially anything using contains check whether element currently within dom however proper fix would hopefully able something better node traversal find roothost full traversal every time contains called arguments would probably bit speed impact seems like needs solved via changes additions dom methods ca nt imagine design shadow root would effectively destroy use dom always require climbing tree either intent indeed hide containment case seems wrong us rereveal least method teasealancs could limit performance degradation cases shadow roots need found however dmethvin brings good point sometimes need get browsers fix problem bit funny thing think one hand elements shadow root interpreted portion dom separate main body elem shadow root return false also note spec details element shadow root property set shadow host value shadow host element hosting shadow root sure hand though currently nt method function specified part spec acts like takes shadow roots consideration thing found thus far tell us definitively whether element shadow root host term represent shadow host nt necessarily think intention conceal containment given shadow host element easily retrieve shadow root using property however think intention separate dom area hidden main dom get feeling lacking part specification moment yes perhaps launching browser inquiry would good idea going pull mikesherov opinion also see could recommend good place raise issue ran issue going agree teasealancs looks like specification needs rethought updated nt seem palatable fix current dom methods discussion last year wrote patch makes working properly actually similar mzgol wrote first comment thing jquery uses hood works fine elements problem check whether element disconnected dom nt found better way rather recursive traversal

hidden disconnected return zeroes visible tree anywhere tree return real box one problem hidden elements jquery currently returns box disconnected elements returns always know artifact useful someone uses probably might break compatibility anyway leave alternative solution also far see tests behavior think method break compatibility even drop condition execute always first part possible could use

disconnected dom node exist first place workaround browsers longer needed optimisation step prevent needless call potentially expensive function former sure latter think performance thanks phpstorm

disconnected elements change preserve anything uses native functions work fine like without redundant check work even faster need check usages every particular case determine whether need many cases

drop support edge case opinion worth especially new major version also break wellwritten code something wrong getting offset disconnected node also break wellwritten code something wrong getting offset disconnected node agree completely problem people write bad code time sometimes accident cases like quietly return values make seem like everything okay would preferred ticket closed getting

earliest none matters shrinkwrapping time release would nt existing wow synchronicity outlines problems proposes solution unless plan make jquery metaproject ship smaller standalone libraries like think would great idea suggested solution slightly different problem hate thatguy frequently point handcrafted perlibrary build tools antipattern h andcrafted perlibrary build tools add complexity already complex problem one things say modularity javascript nearly every library consumer agrees vehemently people nt want ship code nt use one solution custom builds via build tools especially useful solution world globals dominant module system happen small dependency graph apps get complicated dependency graph grows custom builds start add rather subtract complexity example imagine library x really composed smaller parts ship x standalone package hear projects use parts use etc build tool lets one project define smaller subset x dependency begin combine multiple projects depend different subsets x run trouble let say project depends possibly ships project depends possibly ships leave consumer know need custom build eat cost shipping bits twice dependencies depend x likely ship gt mistake best idea heard resolving problem goes like author modules transpile builds support amd cjs retain modularity also ship globals build people prefer people need ship minimal code allow treeshake preferred module syntax supports treeshaking application build time instead library build time module first approach monolithic build exception like sounds good trek nodebased tool chain would describe box module approach core could take look globalize modules granular source files assembled functional groups similarly could jqueryjs base jqueryajaxjs jquerydeferredjs module approach pushing handcrafted build tools onto consumers using internally assemble consumabledist modules jaubourg tooling exists several options one recommend integrating existing build process trivial sample one using broccoli repo example authoring small project transpiling amd cjs globals npm publishing also see readme info note wanted made folder contain files authored modules would breaking change since publish npm would require bumping major version going seems like good moment one way compatible module formats would transpile amd commonjs put output files would make package larger surely make people complain size already thing consider happy help however ember already using modules able everything else shake part application build process hugely valuable already tried gruntbased custom build back ran problem described say confidence would nt use custom build tool angular also module based imagine boat probably subset users would use build tool suggesting making small wrapper around real modules setup one way compatible module formats would transpile amd commonjs put output files would make package larger surely make people complain size already thing consider chime place publish modules strongly urge reconsider putting compile source version control future versions sure keenly aware many annoying problems causes really love larger projects come together help bower solve us note wanted made folder contain files authored modules would breaking change since publish npm would require bumping major version going seems like good moment worry get today without breaking public api needing version bump start authoring modules somewhere else eg add src wo nt end version control add wo nt npm compile add pre postpublish scripts source source control github npm build npm source control nt contain built assets npm nt contain authoring files precisely demonstrates building notice nt appear anywhere source gitignored relevant entry entry points distcjsindexjs authoring code nt pollute npm npm ignored also popular converter want author modules use language features example using jquery amd format leverage get custom builds could optimized use requirejs calculate dependencies

yields something like functions looking variable value add iife wrapped functions output variable requirejs load needed functions custom build allow user download custom build proof concept wrote fun
