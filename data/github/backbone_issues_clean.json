That's because class methods has no property \"prototype\", which is used in Backbone.Collection.prototype.modelId method.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNo error thrown if collection has property \"model\" defined as class method.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nError \"Cannot read property 'idAttribute' of undefined\" thrown.\r\nHere is an example: https://jsfiddle.net/e1ybjmw3/\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n1.

Smilarly subsequent changes to model should trigger 'change' event on model. \r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nShould wrap trigger logic around try/finally block ensuring this._changing and this._pending are set to false."

We are not using a backend - backbone is only used as a utility to create Models and Collections. The problem is that at the moment a Model gets created at one users machine with a particular cid which we use to identify it later (in collections etc). Unfortunately when the model's JSON representation is sent over the network to another user and it is instantiated as a Model instance on his machine a new cid is generated by backbone which causes the two users enviroments to be desyncronized. Is there a way to tell backbone to use a particular cid when creating a model? I know that I can manually change it after model creation but that breaks our app's flow in terms of event listeners not being able to identify the model properly.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help."

    "body": "We are running quite old version of the Backbone in a production and it has served well, thank you guys. Now some other library requires a newer version of the Backbone and we have a small issue with the new version. We can fix the issue quite easily, but as I searched a reason for it, I begun to think that is this `modelId` functionality of the Collection valid idea at all? (A related commit can be found [here](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/commit/4e2d20918f091b2f989a0baf85a12813a414e2f0))\r\n\r\nSo the issue is that one cannot use the `get` function of Backbone.Collection if the `model` property of the collection is not set and models inside the collection have a `idAttribute` overridden.\r\n\r\nE.g. following code logs `undefined`, although I would expect it to log the model object (code \"works\" in the version 1.1.2)\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar MyModel = Backbone.Model.extend({ \r\n\tidAttribute: 'myid'\r\n});\r\nvar m = new MyModel({myid:'xxx'});\r\nvar c = new Backbone.Collection([m]); \r\nvar byId = c.get(m.id); \r\nconsole.log(byId); // byId is undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I define the `model` property for a collection, it works as I expect, but I think that a collection should not _need_ to know about models it contains.\r\n\r\nI think that `modelId` functionality breaks quite a fundamental behavior (get by id) to solve an edge case issue. And if this functionality is valid, I think that a [API documentation](http://backbonejs.org/#Collection-get) should mention that the `model` of the Collection must be defined.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nAnd **thank** you for your work, you have made the world better.\r\n\r\n"

What is happening?\r\n\r\nHere's the code:\r\n```javascript\r\n  Backbone.Model.prototype.parse = function(resp, options) {\r\n    return escapeStringsRecursively(resp);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function escapeStringsRecursively(o) { //https://github.com/wesleytodd/recursive-escape/blob/master/index.js\r\n    if (typeof o === 'undefined' || o === null)\r\n      return o;\r\n    if (o instanceof Array)\r\n      for (var i = 0; i < o.length; i++) {\r\n        o[i] = escapeStringsRecursively(o[i]); }\r\n    else if (typeof o === 'object')\r\n      for (var i in o) {\r\n        if (o.hasOwnProperty(i))\r\n          o[i] = escapeStringsRecursively(o[i]); }\r\n    else if (typeof o === 'string')\r\n      o = _.escape(o);\r\n    return o;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see in the .gif below when I first load the page my parse method catches strings with `script` in them and escapes them to the screen with nice HTML. Then I navigate to another page and return. Now the method never fires, the page is broken, and the script tags have run console.errors\r\n\r\n![test](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5468805/20670004/9f998c90-b57f-11e6-8522-577c8c0cc5a1.gif)\r\n\r\nI logged a SO question here too in case someone can help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40842209/how-to-html-escape-strings-from-the-server-in-backbone-js"

I fetch 1 of the 3 objects from the server - here I discovered the bug\n\nAt this point in time the list contains 3 objects:\ncid: c16 - id: 57\ncid: c17 - id: AA\ncid: c18 - id: AD\nA new object is added:\ncid: 25 - id: 57\n\nIn the _byId object cache one entry for cid 25 is added (as the one by Id already exists).\n\nThen the collection attempts to remove the previous 3 objects from the list, so it should remove objects with keys: c16, c17, c18, AA, AD and 57 (this last one I am not sure, because the newly added object has the id 57).\n\nIn method _removeModels, when calling:\n`var model = this.get(models[i]);`\nmodels[i] is the object with cid c16, but the result of this get function is the object with cid 25 (the newly added object), so the c16 object remains in the list and the newly added object is removed.\n\nThe visible side-effect of this bug (how I stumbled on it) is that after such ghost entries remain, when I fetch an empty collection from the server, these ghost objects remain in the collection.\n\nHere's a printscreen of the debug session where I think that the issue lies.\n<img width=\"1016\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-10-28 at 23 57 10\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/23128666/19822970/e1923d0a-9d6e-11e6-8171-6c8c6a5d65ac.png\">\n\nI don't really know how to solve this, but I guess a better mechanism in the \"get\" method would fix it.\n"

    "body": "We just spent some time tracking down a bug on a site where some of our third-party javascript wasn't working properly. Specifically, when creating a Backbone Model object and passing some attributes to inherit, the attributes never ended up on the object.\n\nAfter investigation, we found that the site owner was extending the `Array.prototype` with an `unset` function:\n\n[![https://gyazo.com/324f11d004d78c0f17f1c410776ff0a6](https://i.gyazo.com/324f11d004d78c0f17f1c410776ff0a6.png)](https://gyazo.com/324f11d004d78c0f17f1c410776ff0a6)\n\nThe `set` function takes [options](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js#L469) that can contain an `unset` [property](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js#L487). In our code, we happen to be passing an array of objects as the `options` parameter. Whether this is supported by Backbone or not, I'm unsure, but I think we have wrapped `Backbone.Model` in something that can consume those options downstream.\n\nAnd obviously the most immediate answer is \"stop extending built-ins\". But since us third-party-javascripters rarely have a say in the environment in which our code runs, I figured it was worth it to open an issue.\n\nAnyways, here's a [jsbin](https://jsbin.com/camuyijoza/1/edit?html,js,console) where you can see the problem.\n\nHopefully this helps somebody :)\n"

I was hoping that the convention would be the same, but I understand that collection#create, as the docs state, \"Equivalent to instantiating a model with a hash of attributes, saving the model to the server, and adding the model to the set after being successfully created. Returns the new model. If client-side validation failed, the model will be unsaved, with validation errors.\" If the model was successfully created and added to the collection, why does it return the model created and not the jqXHR when a model was successfully saved? \n\nThis was brought to my attention when I was trying to handle some asynchronous responses on collection model creation. I was having issues waiting for the model to be created in the same fashion as I handle the jqXHR on model#save upon success by using $.when(call). Instead, I have to pass in a success and fail options params to the collection#create method in order to receieve a proper callback. I'm sure having two ways it not that big of the deal however I was hoping for some understanding on the difference. Otherwise, would it be possible to return the jqXHR of the model being returned?

    "body": "SUBJECT: Problem when Model and Collection each have \"parse\" methods.\n\nBy Alexander Danel\n2016-May-27\n\nWhen both \"Collection\" and its underlying \"Model\" each have their own \"parse\" \nmethod defined, an attempt to do \"collection.fetch()\" causes a problem.\nThe retrieved data is processed first by \"collection.parse()\",\nand then a little bit later the processed data is passed to \n\"model.parse()\", but the second parse fails, because the data\nis cooked, not raw.\n\nThe reason to have a \"parse\" method on the Model is because I do sometimes\ninstantiate the Model as a singleton, not just as a member of the collection.\nIn other words, although the model gets instantiated automatically by the\ncollection in some parts of my program, I also want to sometimes manually\ninstantiate it.  (Automatic bulk instantiations versus manual singleton\ninstantiations.)\n\nThe workaround, for me, I suppose, is to define two different Model classes \nthat are otherwise identical except that one would have \"parse\" and the other \nwould not.  But, that's not elegant.  The intention is that they should both\nthe bulk and singleton instantiations should be of one class.\n\nPROPOSAL: It is my understanding that the \"options\" to an instantiation can \ninclude a value for \"parse\" that is true/false.   Therefore, I suggest that\nthis option be used when the Collection instantiates a Model, temporarily\nsetting \"parse:false\".\n\nI am on Mac OS, working in Chrome, using the following backbone version:\n\n`// Current version of the library. Keep in sync with package.json \n     Backbone.VERSION = 1.2.3;\n`\n\n(Note: I am attempting to use the \"insert code\" feature on this site, but when I switch to \"preview\", the results don't look like code.

If there is interest I'd be happy to open a PR to explore further.  \n"

In fact, it's been the cause of many bugs.  If there's a universe in which that behavior is useful, I'd love to understand it.\n\nIn some of our codebase we solve that problem with this ugly pattern: \n\n```\ndispatcher.off(event, function, ctx); // remove any/all handlers\ndispatcher.on(event, function, ctx); // add one handler\n```\n\n... and in other parts of our codebase, I'm sure it remains un-solved.  Duplicate events creep in, silently.  At best we don't notice them, at worst they cause strange slowness & other behavior that's hard to debug.\n\nIn my dream world, Backbone.Event.on() would detect when I try to bind an event that is already bound to that function with that context, and silently do nothing.  \n\n(Perhaps there's a bit more complexity to that for the corner-case of interleaving on() and once().)\n"

    "created_at": "2016-04-11T12:01:14Z",
    "updated_at": "2016-04-11T12:46:26Z",
    "body": "We recently stumbled about a change that was introduced in version 1.1.1, caused by issue #2846:\n- Before that version:\n  - You could have nested changes with own options - without regarding other listeners to the \"change\" event. \n  - You could use these own options in concrete change:attribute callbacks.\n  - You didn't get these own options in callbacks to a \"change\" event (which causes the issue)\n- Now, since version 1.1.1:\n  - The options hash has side effects:\n  - The options hash of the final \"change\" event depends on the last call to the set method - which can be done by any listener/callback by any other model or view.\n  - You can never be sure, that the options hash of a \"change\" callback is replaced by one of a inner change\n\nNotice the problem?\nSure, both cases have their problem. But I really think that the second case causes much more new problems than it solves. Because really, what was implemented there is a side effect. \nYou can now accidentally \"destroy\" the options hash of another listener, which may be set by a very different module in your application. This hurts the principle of encapsulation and modularization...\n\nHere's an example for what happens currently:\n\n``` javascript\n\n// File A\nthis.listenTo(anyModel, \"change\", function(model, options) {\n  options = options || {};  // Hash is always empty\n\n  if(options.fooFlag) {  // Flag will never exist\n     doSomething();\n  }\n});\n\n// File B\nthis.listenTo(anyModel, \"change:anAttribute\", function(model, newVal) {\n  model.set(\"anotherAttribute\", 42);  // Passing no options -> Accidentally overwrites hash for change event\n});\n\n// File C:\nanyModel.set(\"anAttribute\", 23, {fooFlag: true});\n```\n\nSo what you want to do in file B, is just setting another attribute. But if you do not regard the listener in file A (as in this example), you break it. Therefor you _must_ check all other listeners: Are they using options? Or you always have to pass around the options hash by inner changes.\n\nBut even then you can only _add_ (or overwrite) flags to the final options hash of the \"change\" event. You cannot use options for a change:attribute event only.\nAs an example you may think of a kind of \"disabling flag\":\n\n``` javascript\n\n// File A\nthis.listenTo(anyModel, \"change\", function(model, options) {\n  options = options || {};  // Always contains disableSomething flag\n\n  if(!options.disableSomething) {  // Never true, but expected to be true for default options\n       doSomething();\n  }\n});\n\n// File B\nthis.listenTo(anyModel, \"change:anAttribute\", function(model, newVal) {\n  model.set(\"anotherAttribute\", 42, {disableSomething: true});  // We don't want to call doSomething() a second time (and cannot use silent flag)\n});\n\n// File C:\nanyModel.set(\"anAttribute\", 23);\n```\n## A kind of proposal\n\nIn my opinion the current behavior is not obvious - the default case should be the first/old one of version 1.1.0.\nIf you intentionally (for whatever reason) want to have the options hash of an inner change to the final \"change\" event, then there are two possibilities:\n- A kind of new flag for the set method to force using inner hash options\n- Using the reference nature of the options hash: If you set additional flags to the options hash from inside a change callback, they are simultaneously set to the original hash (because it's passed in by reference):\n\n``` javascript\n\n// File A\nthis.listenTo(anyModel, \"change\", function(model, options) {\n  options = options || {};  // Hash contains fooFlag and myOwnOption\n\n  if(options.fooFlag) {\n     doSomething();\n  }\n});\n\n// File B\nthis.listenTo(anyModel, \"change:anAttribute\", function(model, newVal, options) {\n  options = options || {};  // Hash contains fooFlag\n  options.myOwnOption = 123;\n\n  model.set(\"anotherAttribute\", 42, options);\n});\n\n// File C:\nanyModel.set(\"anAttribute\", 23, {fooFlag: true});\n```\n## Side note\n\nFinally I really want to stress out to explicitly mention such changes in the changelog ;-)\nIf you look into the changelog of version 1.1.1: There is only the point \"Performance fine-tuning for Backbone Events.\"\nThis can be anything, but surely not a change causing different behavior on backbone models!\nIn our team we did a search over hours to find the problem caused by this change - till we found out that backbone is doing something different here.\n"

I'm dealing with a ton of legacy code, some of which uses 2-way data binding and I don't want to update the actual model until the user clicks save.  Hence I use a dummy model (clone), and when the user clicks save I use the extra information within _cloneOf to drive what happens next.  Of course, ideally I would just rip out the 2-way data binding and use the actual model to drive the view.  \n\nAs such, I'm wondering if anyone else would find this useful?  I'm not sure what another use case might be, and my current use case feels too specific to my own situation (in other words, other people who want this should just monkey patch it as well).  \n"

In Backbone 1.2.3, the this pointer defaulted to the original this pointer when where the callback was registered.\n\nI am not trying to imply that the change is wrong.  Backbone does not appear to document what the context will be if the third parameter to the Events.once call is left off.   I am simply pointing out that the default behavior has changed. \n\nOne fallout of this change is that Marionette.Backbone CollectionView no longer works with Backbone 1.3.1.   This is because of the following:\n\n```\nthis.once('render', this._initialEvents);\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/blob/master/src/collection-view.js#L25\n\nThe Marionette CollectionView is registering a callback, leaving off the third \"context\" parameter.   In Backbone 1.2.3, the callback context defaulted to the 'this' pointer.   In Backbone 1.3.1, the callback context defaults to the callback function itself.\n\nThe fix to Marionette is simple:\n\n```\nthis.once('render', this._initialEvents, this);\n```\n\nProblem solved.   However, I am simply opening this issue because it represents what might be considered by some to be a breaking change.\n"

I was under the impression I had it all figured out but I just realized that wasn't the case.\n\nThe problem: My partner created our group's repository. I made a fork of his repository and started adding commits and pushed it to github, but I'm getting this on my repository: \"This branch is 2 commits ahead of myPartnersName:master. \"\n\nI read some tutorial and I thought it said to fork their repository, but maybe it was a tutorial for something else. I want to use his repository. I check his repository and sure enough, it's missing the 2 commits that I made that appears on my fork.\n\nPretty simple I guess. I hope it's a simple fix and that someone can help! \n"

    "body": "So I was doing a project for work recently that involved the following workflow\n1. Hit a web endpoint that returns a list of stanzas that is a comma separated string in the order they should be displayed in some UI\n   Ex: /endpoint/stanzas => \"stanza1,stanza2,stanza3,stanza4\"\n2. Split into list, and hit the endpoints for all those stanzas to get more detail about them for the display\n   Ex /endpoint/stanzas/stanza{1-4} => { some: data, etc: [1,2,3] }\n\nSo since all of them were getting asynchronously sent, I also wanted to add them to my collection in the order that the list in step 1 was ordered.  For this, I ran _.map() on the comma split list of that string, and stored the index as the point to insert at.  Ex: collection.add(fetchedModel, {at: storedIndex});  However, it turns out that the collection doesn't quite behave like a Javascript array and you cannot insert it at a non-existing index since the collection doesn't dynamically resize.  Being Javascript, I thought Backbone would intuitively do this, and I lost a lot of time debugging an error as a result.\n\nMy suggestion would be the following:\n1. Add in the docs for collection.add() at backbonejs.org that providing an index to the \"at\" option that is larger than the size of the collection will not dynamically resize the collection.\n2. I am happy to implement a branch and create a pull request that will actually provide this functionality if it is desired.\n"

    "body": "Right now `modelId(attrs)` is only passed a plain-object representation of the model's attributes. This makes it difficult for application developers to create n-degree polymorphic Collection subclasses.\n\nContrived Example:\n\n``` javascript\n// A collection of mixed entity types that maintains sort order based \n// on their joinDate property\n\nvar Entities = Collection.extend({\n  modelId(attrs){\n    // What ID attribute to use? Not determined at runtime.\n  },\n  comparator: 'joinDate'\n});\n\n\n// These are only two entity types with different idAttributes, but assume \n// There may be up to (n) different entity types, each with different idAttributes, \n// determined by the database backing this example application.\n\nvar Company = Model.extend({\n  idAttribute: 'companyId'\n});\n\nvar Customer = Model.extend({\n  idAttribute: 'customerId'\n});\n\n// Proceeding to add and remove Customers, Companies, etc, to the Entities\n// Collection will mess up the `_byId` cache because the Entities collection\n// is not aware of all the different possibilities for `idAttribute` at runtime and \n// a `modelId` method cannot be written to satisfy the needs of this app.\n\n```\n\nIf the modelId callback took the form `modelId(attrs, model)`, where the second argument is the model in question, Backbone can retain backwards compatibility but allow application developers to do something like this:\n\n``` javascript\n// Always give precedence to the provided model's idAttribute. \n// Fall back to the Collection's idAttribute, and then to the default value `id`.\n\nEntities.modelId = function modelId(attrs, model){\n  return attrs[model.idAttribute || this.model.prototype.idAttribute || 'id'];\n};\n```\n\nIt may even make sense to make the above `modelId` function the default implementation and support polymorphic Collections out of the box. It still maintains backwards compatibility: For any implementation that is not already polymorphic, Collections will still function normally \u2013\u00a0models will have their idAttribute set when added to the Collection by the Collection's model constructor. Those that are already polymorphic, or have some type of non-standard idAttributes, will already have this modelId method overwritten.\n\nHappy to throw up a PR if you think this is a good idea.\n"

But the remote object still exists, and the Model instance proxying it still exists. Being removed from the collection does not mean the Model instance is invalid in anyway, yet it gets broken by this. Consider this example: A Collection representing the first page of results on a server. If we do a Collection.fetch({reset: true}), a Model instance may be removed and its ability to talk to remote broken.\n\n(Side note: I also think Model.collection.url should override Model.urlRoot,or alternatively urlRoot should be set to the last collection it was added to.

    "body": "This is an rather small issue with route parameters and ES6 default parameters that I just ran into and thought I would just bring it up (semi-related to #3828 I guess):\n\nSay we have an Router that looks like this:\n\n```\nconst Router = Backbone.Router.extend({\n    routes: {\n        \"(:foo)(/)(:bar)\": \"biz\"       \n    }\n});\n\nlet router = new Router();\n\nrouter.on(\"route:init\", (foo, bar) => {\n  console(foo, bar);\n});\n```\n\nIn [backbone.js#L1532](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/c20ca2e3f6dc28aba0ff019d269650406a140c73/backbone.js#L1532) the comment above the `_extractParameters` method states:\n\n>  // Given a route, and a URL fragment that it matches, return the array of\n>     // extracted decoded parameters. Empty or unmatched parameters will be\n>     // treated as `null` to normalize cross-browser behavior.\n\nWhen navigating to `foo.com`, we get the following output:\n\n```\nconsole.log(foo, bar) // null, null\n```\n\nThere's nothing wrong with this, but it gets a bit more trickier when [default parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/default_parameters) come in:\n\nSay we want to use some default parameters if none are supplied, in ES5 we would do something like this:\n\n```\nrouter.on(\"route:init\", (foo, bar) => {\n  foo ? foo : \"hamburger\";\n  bar ? bar : \"vegan\";\n  console(foo, bar);\n});\n```\n\nIn ES6, one could just use default parameters: \n\n```\nrouter.on(\"route:init\", (foo = \"hamburger\", bar = \"vegan\") => {\n   console(foo, bar); // expected: hamburger, vegan\n});\n```\n\nHowever, as MDN states: \n\n> Default function parameters allow formal parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or undefined is passed.\n\nThe output from that is still `null, null` because the passed in values are `null`, rendering default parameters useless.\n\n```\nrouter.on(\"route:init\", (foo = \"hamburger\", bar = \"vegan\") => {\n   console(foo, bar); // null, null\n});\n```\n\nSolution would be passing no value at all or undefined instead of null, but I am not sure which browsers the comment about cross-browser inconsistencies refers to. \nThe workarounds are rather trivial (and it might not be the best use-case in general either), so the issue is not that urgent by any means.\n"

    "body": "See comment below, this bug can be recreated without using `{silent: true}` at all.\n\n[fiddle without `{silent: true}`](https://jsfiddle.net/9rsgxbb0/1/)\noriginal [fiddle with `{silent: true}`](https://jsfiddle.net/g4576ewz/)\n\nI recently upgraded from Backbone 1.1.2 to Backbone 1.2.3. With my project as it is, when I remove a single item from a collection, that item **and the last item** (erroneously) in the collection are removed. The reason for this has to do with two things:\n- In the relevant code, `remove` is typically mapped to `destroy`. The reasoning is that we don't want uncollected detritus floating about in case someone accidentally uses `remove` on the collection.\n- In the newer backbone version, `destroy` no longer behaves as it did before as regards the `silent: true` option.\n\nDestroy [triggers a remove event](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js#L1156) that can no longer be silenced, which is conceptually fine as we have indeed already removed the model from the collection. However as occurs in #3847 , `collection.get(model)` succeeds where `collection.indexOf(model)` returns `-1`. The logic leading to the faulty removal occurs at [line 1103](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js#L1103), and just below [line 1106](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js#L1106) contains a splice that given `-1` as an index removes the last element in the collection. `this.get(model)`, which is tested to prevent attempts to remove already removed items, [delegates to `_byId`](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js#L973) which does not contain the model itself as a key, but does contain the model's id and cid when it shouldn't.\n\nAny one of the following changes will fix this bug:\n- `destroy` changed to not trigger a `'remove'` event when given the `{ silent: true }` option\n- `_removeModels` modified to not splice out the last list element when `indexOf(model) == -1`\n- removed model's cid and id removed from `_byId` before second remove call occurs\n\nPlease let me know if there is a simple fix for my code which maintains the functionality of destroying an object when a remove event occurs.\n\nThe following code will reproduce this bug (or just use [the fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/g4576ewz/)):\n\n``` html\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"collection\"></div>\n    <div id=\"buttons\"></div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n``` javascript\ndefine([\n  'backbone'\n],\nfunction (Backbone) {\n  var Collection = Backbone.Collection.extend({\n    endsInDestruction: function (model, collection, options) {\n      // the silent option will apply to remove events, preventing an infinite loop here.\n      // You can remove it to observe the infinite loop.\n      model.destroy({ silent: true });\n    },\n    initialize: function (options) {\n      this.listenTo(this, 'remove', this.endsInDestruction);\n      this.listenTo(this, 'add change remove', this.render);\n    },\n\n    el: $('#collection'),\n    render: function () {\n      $(this.el).html('<ul></ul>');\n      var list = $('ul', this.el);\n      this.forEach(function(model) {\n        list.append('<li>' + model.get('name') + '</li>');\n      });\n    }\n  });\n  var collection = new Collection();\n  collection.render();\n\n  // add two models, keeping a reference to one of them.\n  collection.add({\n    name: 'foobardi'\n  });\n  var model = collection.add({\n    name: 'caesar'\n  });\n\n  // This erroneously removes two items from the collection\n  function removeIt () {\n    collection.remove(model);\n    console.log('done');\n  }\n\n  // binds a button to remove an item at your leisure.\n  $('#buttons').html('<button type=\"button\" id=\"main-button\">Remove One Model</button>');\n  $('#main-button').click(removeIt);\n});\n```\n"

    "body": "Backbone currently doesn't play nicely with NoSQL REST APIs, like MongoDB, because it rely's substantially on a [specific format](http://backbonejs.org/#API-integration) for the API.\n\nThis can all be overridden, but it results in a lot of boilerplate code. For MongoDB, you would use `idAttribute` to set something like the book name to as the main identifier, so the API would look like:\n\n```\nGET  /books/ .... collection.fetch();\nPOST /books/ .... collection.create();\nGET  /books/:name ... model.fetch();\nPUT  /books/:name ... model.save();\nDEL  /books/:name ... model.destroy();\n```\n\nBut since MongoDB uses a document attribute as the unique key, backbone will erroneously assume that `isNew` is false when trying to create a new entry on [save](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-save):\n\n> If the model isNew, the save will be a \"create\" (HTTP POST), if the model already exists on the server, the save will be an \"update\" (HTTP PUT).\n\nOne solution is to pass in the request method (ie. `post`) manually on `.save` requests. But then the burden is on the coder to add extra boilerplate to figure out when to CREATE or UPDATE in any given view.\n\nThe easier solution to this is to override `isNew` under [Backbone.Model](http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html#backbone-model) with something that plays nicer with MongoDB. The problem creating all of this boilerplate is written in the comments for `isNew`:\n\n> A model is new if it has never been saved to the server, and lacks an id.\n\nNoSQL databases like MongoDB don't rely on ids like RDMS solutions do. Thus it confuses a new document as an old one and issues a PUT request instead of POST, which requires either boilerplate on the `.save` calls, or overriding `isNew` somehow.\n\nBackbone already is pretty unopinionated, but this is something that just feels a little to hacky to be considered clean. It should be able to support NoSQL better for this particular scenario. \n\nMy suggestion is to update the `isNew` method to return `false` if the model has not been synchronized with the server. Implicitly this would mean that the model is new. Or if backwards compatibility is an issue, have an option, such as `emulateNoSQL`, that will properly set up the API and `isNew` to play nicely with NoSQL database APIs.\n"

    "updated_at": "2015-12-09T16:40:54Z",
    "body": "During model change event, when `id` attribute changes, the internal `_byId` index of containing collection is invalid. Because of this, the model cannot be obtained with `collection.get(id)` method, even though it has ID attribute already set. This is non-intuitive as internal indexing of collections should be transparent to the end user, and when `collection.get(ID)` returns null, it should be be safe to assume that the model with such ID does not exist in collection. \n\nInternally, this issue is caused by delayed firing of collection's `_onModelEvent` method which maintains the `byId` index (https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/05fde9e201f7e2137796663081105cd6dad12a98/backbone.js#L1144). It is being bound to the `all` event on model level, and `all` handlers are invoked only after all other events are processed (https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/05fde9e201f7e2137796663081105cd6dad12a98/backbone.js#L357) making the collection update it's index only after change handlers are executed.\n\nPlease see the example below:\n\n```\nclass Entry extends Backbone.Model\n  initialize: =>\n    @on 'change', (e) =>\n      console.log('onChange Model ', e.id, window.collection.get(e.id), window.collection.get(e.cid), window.collection.get(e.cid).id)\n\nclass Collection extends Backbone.Collection\n  model: Entry\n  initialize: =>\n    @on 'change', (e) =>\n      console.log('onChange Collection', e.id, window.collection.get(e.id), window.collection.get(e.cid))\n\nwindow.collection = new Collection()\nentry = collection.add({'name':'unsaved'})\nentry.set({'name':'saved', 'id':10})\n```\n\nIt's console output is:\n\n```\nonChange Model 10 undefined Entry {cid: \"c1\", \u2026} 10\nonChange Collection 10 Entry {cid: \"c1\", \u2026} Entry {cid: \"c1\", \u2026}\n```\n\nPlease note that in the model change handler the collection is in invalid state, as `collection.get(10)` produced `undefined` while `collection.get('c1').id` returns 10, meaning that the object with ID 10 is actually in the collection.\n\nAlso, the second line shows inconsistency with the `change` event bound at the collection level, which behaves correctly.\n"

    "body": "I am in the process of refactoring my code Backbone codebase to leverage new the ES6 features. One of the features I am most excited about is the Module system introduced in ES6. I am still playing around with different bundlers to be able to load it into current browsers that don't support ES6 yet.\n\n**Just curious to see how people are using Backbone in conjunction with ES6 Modules?**\n\nI have seen two approaches with regards to Underscore, jQuery, and Backbone libraries:\n\nAssuming the following html file:\n\n``` html\n<!-- index.html -->\n<script src=\"underscore.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"jquery.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"backbone.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"one.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"two.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"main.js\"></script>\n```\n\n**Load the libraries onto the global window object and access them via the window object.**\nThis seems like the traditional way of declaring library dependencies. It doesn't require adding boilerplate imports in all of your custom Backbone files/modules.\n\n``` javascript\n// File: one.js\n// access Backbone via the global object\nexport default OneView = Backbone.View.extend({\n  el: '.one'\n});\n```\n\n``` javascript\n// File: two.js\n// access Backbone via the global object\nexport default TwoView = Backbone.View.extend({\n  el: '.one'\n});\n```\n\n``` javascript\n// File: main.js\nimport OneView from './one.js';\nimport TwoView from './two.js';\n\n// access backbone via global\nvar m = new Backbone.Model();\nvar v1 = new OneView();\nvar v2 = new TwoView();\n```\n\n**Explicitly import the libraries for each new module you create**\nThis is very explicit but each individual file is very clear about what it is dependent on. If you unit test a file in isolation, all of it's dependencies are stated and should be more self-contained. It feels kind of bloated though to include all those imports in each custom Backbone file. This type of format will also play nicely with browserify/webpack and other bundlers. It also feels like how other languages module systems work.\n\n``` javascript\n// File: one.js\nimport $ from 'jquery';\nimport _ from 'underscore';\nimport Backbone from 'backbone';\n\nexport default OneView = Backbone.View.extend({\n  el: '.one'\n});\n```\n\n``` javascript\n// File: two.js\nimport $ from 'jquery';\nimport _ from 'underscore';\nimport Backbone from 'backbone';\n\nexport default TwoView = Backbone.View.extend({\n  el: '.one'\n});\n```\n\n``` javascript\n// File: main.js\nimport $ from 'jquery';\nimport _ from 'underscore';\nimport Backbone from 'backbone';\n\nimport OneView from './one.js';\nimport TwoView from './two.js';\n\n// access backbone via global\nvar m = new Backbone.Model();\nvar v1 = new OneView();\nvar v2 = new TwoView();\n```\n\nI could probably combine the jquery, underscore and backbone imports into one helper module that exports all three so that it would only be one export:\n`export {$, _, Backbone} from './BackboneHelper';`\n\nCurious to see if anyone else has found some useful conventions or wanted to discuss the tradeoffs they've experienced between the two methods.\n"

    "body": "This issue seems related to [#3842](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/3842) but this also happens for values as well as keys.\n\nIn FireFox if you create a collection that uses the `idAttribute` field to do a id lookup. The lookup will return the wrong value if the value of a models idAttribute is also a value on Object.prototype. For example, `watch`.\n\nIn the referenced issue, people have mentioned not using prototype names as default properties, which I can understand, but attribute values should not have a limitation as we aren't always in control of what those values may be.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n``` javascript\nvar M = Backbone.Model.extend({\n    idAttribute: 'type',\n    defaults: {\n        'type': '',\n        'name': ''\n    }\n});\n\nvar model1 = new M({'type': 'watch', name: 'Watch'});\nvar model2 = new M({'type': 'other', name: 'Other'});\n\nvar C = Backbone.Collection.extend({\n    model: M\n});\n\nvar collection = new C();\n\n// add the models\ncollection.add(model1);\ncollection.add(model2);\n\n// try and get the model with type: 'watch'\nconsole.log(collection.get('watch'));\nconsole.log(collection.length);\n\n// LOG: function watch()\n// LOG: 1\n```\n\nThe above example only happens in firefox but in Chrome you can see the same behavior if you add the following:\n\n``` javascript\nvar model3 = new M({'type': 'constructor', name: 'Constructor'});\n\ncollection.add(model3);\nconsole.log(collection.get('constructor'));\n\n// LOG: function Object() { [native code] }\n```\n"

This reference prevents any collection to be garbage collected until every single model is explicitly removed from this collection. \n\nOur application depends on creating many temporary collections (from grouping or filtering results) to re-use extended collection methods on these results, containing already existing models from base collections. \nWe'd like to see these temporary collections garbage collected, once their reference gets discarded (via delete or leaving the scope). Instead we're aggregating references to every single temporary collection within every model, preventing them from ever getting discarded as long as the model is alive. \n\nSolving this problem by calling .reset() on every temporary collection and thereby removing the event listeners would be a major inconvenience. Is there any BB concept enabling us to use temporary backbone collections without forcing us to cleanup by ourselves?\n\nHere is a jsFiddle demonstrating the issue: http://jsfiddle.net/yf2t8w98/1/\nWatching the debugger timeline while running the loop you'll see something like that: \n\n![bb1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15647922/11179088/451b0e5e-8c51-11e5-812f-6c25024560c8.png)\n"

A button to get user details !}\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThis is my partial below - `responseMessage.dust`\n\n```\n<div id=\"responseMessage\">\n  {@eq key=\"{data.success}\" value=\"true\"}\n    <div class=\"alert alert-success success\" role=\"alert\">success</div>\n  {/eq}\n</div>\n```\n\nMy JS looks like this\n\n```\ninitialize: function() {\n    this.responseMessageView = this.responseMessageView ||\n        new ResponseMessageView({\n            model: new Backbone.Model()\n        }); // View is for the partial\n    this.model = this.model || new Backbone.Model(); //View for the whole page\n},\n```\n\nBelow function is called when an event occurs and it does a POST and returns successfully.\n\n```\nprimaryViewEventTrigger: function(event){\n  //Button click on `index.dust` triggers this event and does a POST event to the backend\n\n  this.listenToOnce(this.model, 'sync', this.primaryViewSuccess);//this will render the whole view. \n  this.listenToOnce(this.model, 'error', this.primaryViewError);\n  this.model.save({data: {x:'123'}});\n}\n\nresponseViewEventTrigger: function(event){\n  //Button click on `responseMessage.dust` triggers this event and does a POST event to the backend\n\n  this.listenToOnce(this.responseMessageView.model, 'sync', this.responseViewSuccess);//it should only render the partial view - responseMessage.dust\n  this.listenToOnce(this.responseMessageView.model, 'error', this.primaryViewError);\n  this.responseMessageView.model.save({data: {x:'123'}});\n}\nprimaryViewSuccess: function(model,response){\n    this.model.set('data', response.data);\n    this.render();\n}\nresponseViewSuccess: function(model,response){\n    this.responseMessageView.model.set('data', response.data);\n    console.log(this.responseMessageView.model);\n    this.responseMessageView.render(); // Does not work in some cases\n}\n```\n\nMy implementations of the callback function\n\n```\nexports.sendEmail = function sendEmail(req, res){\n  req.model.data.success = true;\n  responseRender.handleResponse(null, req, res);\n};\n```\n\n`this.model` belongs to the model of the whole page. Whereas `this.responseMessageView.model` is the model for the partial. \n\nQuestion: This works perfectly fine in most of the cases. There is one case where it does not render the partial with the latest model values. When I click on the button on `index.dust` and `primaryViewSuccess` is executed. After which I click on another button and trigger `responseViewEventTrigger`. It does the POST successfully and it comes to `responseViewSuccess` and stores it in the model too. But it does not show it on the frontend. `data.success` is still not true whereas `console.log(this.responseMessageView.model)` show that `attributes->data->success = true`\n\nBut the same behavior when I refresh the page it all works perfect. Its just that when `primaryViewSuccess` is called and then `responseViewSuccess` its not taking the latest model changes.\n\nI have spent days on it and don't understand what I am doing wrong :(  Thanks for your time!\n@jridgewell jashkenas\n"

    "body": "According to the documentation for `collection.remove()`:\n\n\"Remove a model (or an array of models) from the collection, and return them.\"\n\nIt seems the part about returning the removed models is not always the case in the latest stable release, 1.2.3 (as well as the Edge version). What I expected based on the documentation is to get back an array, always, even if the array empty. (This would allow me to do things such as `collection2.add(collection1.remove(someArrayOfModels))` without having to worry about the return type for `remove()`) The problem for me is that `remove()` is actually returning different value types depending on what I pass in as arguments, which you will see below how this can become an issue.\n\nOpen up a browser console with Backbone loaded and attempting the following:\n\n```\n// Start with this for each test case\nvar collection = new Backbone.Collection([new Backbone.Model(), new Backbone.Model()]);\nconsole.log(collection.length); //should be 2\n```\n\nNow trying the following operations (be sure to re-create the collection each time):\n\n```\ncollection.remove(collection.at(0)); //Returns a single model instance\n```\n\n```\ncollection.remove([ collection.at(0), collection.at(1)]) //Returns an array of two model instances\n```\n\n```\ncollection.remove() //Returns 'undefined'\n```\n\n```\ncollection.remove([]) //Returns 'false'\n```\n\nThe last one where I get `false` from `collection.remove([])` is where this really becomes an issue, since when I do `collection.add(false)` it adds a new item to the collection, even though I didn't want to add anything. (try it, and you'll see the collection's `length` property will increase by 1)\n\nSome recommendations I have to resolve this:\n- Update the documentation to clarify the various return types that `remove()` returns back\n- Update `collection.remove()` to always return an array, regardless of input arguments\n- Update `collection.add()` to not add anything if `false` is passed as the first argument\n"

    "body": "## FYI\n\nWhen coding my first Backbone / Marionette Project I run into a strange URI encoding Problem. This means I am far from being a Backbone Professional and maybe I'm getting something wrong.\n## Problem Description\n\nI'm having the following route in my Marionette Router, that handles searches with GET style query parameters.\n\n```\nvar Router = Marionette.AppRouter.extend({\n    appRoutes: {\n        'search(?*query)' : 'search'\n    }\n});\n```\n\nWhen trying to persist my Application State, I need the URL Fragment to be able to handle special Characters like \u00f6,\u00e4,\u00fc correctly. Therefore I encode the Query (e.g. ?loc-city[]=Berlin&loc-cty[]=M\u00fcnchen) and call\n\n```\nrouter.navigate('search?loc-city%5B%5D=M%C3%BCnchen&loc-city%5B%5D=Berlin');\n```\n\nThis works perfectly in most Browsers. But when testing on Safari, I encountered, that in the navigation routine, the fragment will be decoded and then given to Backbone.History._updateHash, which updates the windows location. At this Point Safari (Desktop and Mobile Version) encodes the given fragment in ISO and the query then will be\n\n```\n?loc-city[]=Berlin&loc-city[]=M%FCnchen // notice the %FC which is the url encoded iso char\n```\n\nwhich cannot be consumed by Javascript/Backbone anymore, and break the Code with an URIError (when calling decodeUriComponent in Backbone.Router._extractParameters).\n\nBecause I find not much Information on the Web, I call for your help here, if there's an obvious bug anywhere, or if i got something wrong, please give me a hint. \nI already checked the encoding on all sides, the documents are utf-8, the server delivers the correct encoding as well and the headers also say so.\n"

The full documentation can be [found here](https://github.com/AndrewHenderson/backbone.chain-router/blob/master/README.md).\n#### Example Usage\n\nUsing dot syntax within callback names, we'd be able to chain our callbacks, executing one after the other.\n\n``` js\nBackbone.Router.extend({\n  routes: {\n    'posts/new': 'posts.new'\n  },\n  posts: function () {\n    console.log('posts'); // called first\n  },\n  new: function () {\n    console.log('new'); // called second\n  }\n});\n```\n\nChained routes with parameters would be passed their parameters respectively.\n\n``` js\nroutes: {\n  'post/:post_id/comment/:comment_id': 'post.comment'\n},\npost: function (post_id) {\n  console.log(arguments); // [post_id, null]\n},\ncomment: function (comment_id) {\n  console.log(arguments); // [comment_id, null]\n}\n```\n\nIf we want to include an additional route in the middle of the chain which is not intended to be passed parameters, we bracket that callback.\n\n``` js\nroutes: {\n  'post/:post_id/comments/:comment_id': 'post.[comments].comment'\n},\npost: function (post_id) {\n  console.log(arguments); // [post_id, null]\n},\ncomments: function () {\n  console.log(arguments); // [null] was not passed comment_id\n},\ncomment: function (comment_id) {\n  console.log(arguments); // [comment_id, null]\n}\n```\n"

Just that a lot of add and remove gets fired in some cases where all of my models are replaced. \nTo avoid this, I removed add and remove, so that it will fire only one update to the component. Sometimes it work fine, sometimes it wont. I observed this in situation when all models returned are new and the whole collection is now changed. There is no problem with the network response, I verified it. It just never fires the update event. To confirm, I also did a \"this.bind('update',function().....} and tried logging.. but same problem there.

In 1.2.2 calling `set` is wiping out `model.id` (appears to be from this commit: https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/commit/be7fc959641a3ccaa362110023ea7d697bc3f93b)\n\nYou can run these fiddles and see the output in the console.\n\n1.2.1: https://jsfiddle.net/jktms1xx/2/\n\n``` sh\n> 123\n> 123\n```\n\n1.2.2: https://jsfiddle.net/g1am1otw/1/\n\n``` sh\n> 123\n> undefined\n```\n\n---\n\nWe've resolved this issue by changing our code to call `model.set('id', SOME_ID)` - but we were wondering if setting `model.id` directly should continue to work.

I've long suggested these plugins export a `CustomCollection` and `CustomModel` with a custom `sync` function implemented there, as opposed to globally overriding BB.sync; however they both have some merit. I would suggest something like the following adding a custom sync\n\n``` js\nfunction predicate(model, options) {\n   return model.useProxy;\n}\n\nfunction syncFn(model, options) {\n   // sync function as normal\n}\n\n// Whether this sync method should stop other syncs from being checked.\n// This could be useful for storage syncs which wish to add data to an indexedDb\n// while also executing an http sync\nvar exclusiveSync = false;\n\nBackbone.addSyncMethod(predicate, syncfn, exclusiveSync);\n```\n"

I don't have a ton of XP with `triggerHandler`, so maybe this functionality makes sense, but I was really confused with unexpected results from the following:\n\n```\nvar TestView = Backbone.View.extend({\n  template: _.template('<div class=\"foo\"></div>'),\n  events: {\n    'custom.event .foo': function(){\n      console.log('custom.event ran');\n    }\n  },\n  render: function() {\n    this.$el.html(this.template());\n\n    this.$('.foo').on('custom.event', function(){\n        console.log('custom.event is in here');\n    });\n\n    return this;\n  }\n})\n\nvar testView = new TestView();\ntestView.render();\njQuery.event.trigger('custom.event', null, testView.$('.foo')[0], true);\n```\n\nIn this example only the the event handler bound in render fires, but I thought \"on\" and \"events\" were bound identically.\n\nThis appears to be because of how event delegation works inside of Backbone.View's events hash. Is this intended behavior, something that is a known issue but is just \"lived with,\" or ?\n\nThanks!\n"

This implies that it's ok for non-parsed data to be passed into `Collection#set`.\n\nHowever, if non-parsed data is passed to `Collection#set`, [line 833](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js#L833) may fail to correctly merge the new data with existing data in the collection (in particular, if the non-parsed data is wrapped in a way that obscures the idAttribute).\n\nBelow is a failing test case that illustrates this issue:\n\n```\n  test(\"collection should merge in duplicate raw objects with {merge: true}\", 1, function() {\n    var Model = Backbone.Model.extend({\n      parse: function(data) { return data.wrapper; }\n    });\n\n    var Col = Backbone.Collection.extend({model: Model});\n    var col = new Col;\n\n    col.set([{wrapper: {id: 1, name: 'Foo'}}], {parse: true, merge: true});\n    var firstModel = col.first();\n\n    col.set([{wrapper: {id: 1, name: 'Bar'}}], {parse: true, merge: true});\n    var secondModel = col.first();\n\n    strictEqual(firstModel, secondModel);\n  });\n```\n\n The `{merge: true}` option indicates that the updated model in the collection should be the same object reference, but instead it is a newly instantiated model. \n\nA potential fix might involve changing [line 833](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js#L833) from this:\n\n```\n        if (existing = this.get(attrs)) {\n```\n\nto this:\n\n```\n        existing = this.get(attrs);\n        if (!existing && !this._isModel(attrs) && options.parse) {\n          var tempModel = new this.model(attrs, options);\n          existing = this.get(tempModel.attributes);\n        }\n        if (existing) {\n```\n\nalthough there may be a more elegant solution.

In our work, we consider that a system is in trouble if more than 50% of its files become orphan (i.e., without a main author).\n\nMore details on our work in this preprint: https://peerj.com/preprints/1233\n\nWe calculated the TF for **Backbone** and obtained a value of **2**.\n\nThe developers responsible for this TF are:\n\nJeremy Ashkenas - author of 60% of the files\nBrad Dunbar - author of 33% of the files\n\nTo validate our results, we would like to ask **Backbone** developers the following three brief questions:\n\n(a) Do you agree that the listed developers are the main developers of **Backbone**?\n\n(b) Do you agree that **Backbone** will be in trouble if the listed developers leave the project (e.g., if they win in the lottery, to be less morbid)?\n\n(c) Does **Backbone** have some characteristics that would attenuate the loss of the listed developers (e.g., detailed documentation)?\n\nThanks in advance for your collaboration,\n\nGuilherme Avelino\nPhD Student\nApplied Software Engineering Group (ASERG)\nUFMG, Brazil\nhttp://aserg.labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/\n"

    "body": "Can someone give me OFFICIAL opinion by Backbone.JS how stable is migration/usage of Lodash.\n\nI know these 3:\n- [Lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash)\n- [Lodash.Underscore](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/2.4.1/lodash.underscore.js)\n- [Lodash.Compat](https://github.com/lodash/lodash-compat)\n\nI've read [Lodash Migration notes](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Migrating) but still I want backbone community opion also. I wanna make sure ALL of above lodash version will work correctly with ANY version of backbone starting from 1.1.x.\n\nUPD-1: Trying to digest: https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore/issues/2182\n\nUPD-2: In fact personally me, closer to use Underscore - as a first, original library for similar purposes. I think that John-David SHOULD NOT HAVE forked and create new whell, but instead he should have contributed with/to Underscore and help Jeremy with improving underscore. WHAT bad is in this collaboration? But I'm not so good in history of both libs, so I may be mistaken. So sorry in advance.\n\nUPD-3: Backbone tests. Special thanks to @RusAlex for triggering thinking in that way. So I took 2 versions of backbone and ran tests with different lodash versions.\n\n_Backbone 1.1.2 and_\n- lodash 3.10.1 - no failed tests\n- lodash.compat v3.10.0 - no failed tests\n- lodash from my prj. frozen v. 2.4.1 - no failed testes\n- lodash.underscore v2.4.1 - no failed tests:\n\n_Backbone 1.2.1 and_\n- lodash 3.10.1 - no failed tests\n- lodash.compat v3.10.0 - no failed tests\n- lodash from my prj. v.2.4.1 - **4 failed tests** (68, 69, 200, 202)\n- lodash.underscore v2.4.1 - **20 failed tests** (68, 69, 200, 202, 342-345, 355-363, 366, 368, 370)\n\nSo I assume, that using \"latest versions of libraries on the release moment\" of both of them is appropriate and not risky. And obviously - using different releases/versions is risky.\n"

However, when I iterate over the collection to remove all models I get undefined for the default mode (id=1) only.\nHere is the code:\n\n```\nconsole.log( JSON.stringify(collection.toJSON())); // result above\ncollection.each( function( model ){\n  console.log( \"Removing model from collection to free up mem: \" + JSON.stringify( model ));\n  collection.remove( model );               \n}); //eof each\n```\n\nHere is the result of console.log inside each() above:\n\n```\nRemoving model from collection to free up mem: {\"id\":2,\"firstName\":\"Sido\",\"iconName\":\"icon-gear\",\"unread\":1,\"lastName\":\"595\"}\nRemoving model from collection to free up mem: {\"id\":3,\"firstName\":\"Sido\",\"iconName\":\"icon-gear\",\"unread\":9,\"lastName\":\"696\"}\nRemoving model from collection to free up mem: undefined\n```\n"

This can create \"silent errors\" when responses enter the error callback due to invalid JSON responses but still returned a 200 and status \"OK\".\n\nSince Backbone's default implementation proxies this to jQuery, I think it's a good assumption to make that most users would have an interest in the `textStatus` and `errorThrown` arguments. Maybe it would be a good idea to pass these along with  `error(model, resp, options)`? They could even be tacked onto the response object. It's likely many devs have had issues debugging ajax failures like this and just created catch-alls as a workaround, but I think by allowing easy access to these other two arguments it could allow developers to perform more explicit error handling.\n\n(Somewhat) Relevant discussions:\nhttps://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/2162\nhttps://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/3520\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/16476874/catching-backbone-sync-errors\n"

I'll see something like POST `{first_name: \"John\"}`, POST `{first_name: \"John\", last_name: \"Doe\"}`, instead of the second request being a PUT for `first_name` and `last_name`, and then end up with multiple DB rows that are near identical as fields are sequentially filled in.\n\nI tried the simple solution of deferring saves with deferred objects, but that just seems to lead to the hash sent back from the server's first save clobbering any local changes before the deferred save fires.\n\nThought I'd check before writing something complicated that queues/merges pending changes. Most of the related google results seem to be from several years ago (and haven't worked in tests).\n"

In that I will display some images which will be captured by camera. I am capturing multiple pictures at a time. All the pictures which I have taken, the address of those images will first save into database and then those images will be displayed in collection view.\nNow what happens, when I click 40-50 images at a time, the app is crashed and xcode displays a message something like \"app is terminating due to memory pressure\". Also I am getting too many memory warnings in logs but actually I was neglecting them.\n\nFirst I am writing code for taking multiple pictures-\n\n```\n- (void)imagePickerController:(UIImagePickerController *)picker \ndidFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:(NSDictionary *)info\n{\n  if ([UIImagePickerController isSourceTypeAvailable:UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera]) {\n    //Get Image URL from Library\n    NSString *mediaType = [info objectForKey:UIImagePickerControllerMediaType];\n    NSURL *urlPath = [info valueForKey:UIImagePickerControllerReferenceURL];\n    if (segmentControl.selectedSegmentIndex != 1) {\n        [picker dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];\n    }\n    if (segmentControl.selectedSegmentIndex == 2) {\n        [self insertPicToDB:urlPath];\n    }else{\n        __block  NSURL *url;\n        if ([mediaType isEqualToString:(NSString *)kUTTypeImage]) {\n            UIImage *image = [info objectForKey:UIImagePickerControllerOriginalImage];\n            ALAssetsLibrary *library = [[ALAssetsLibrary alloc] init];\n            // Request to save the image to camera roll\n            [library writeImageToSavedPhotosAlbum:[image CGImage] orientation:(ALAssetOrientation)[image imageOrientation] completionBlock:^(NSURL *assetURL, NSError *error){\n                if (error) {\n\n                } else {\n                    url = assetURL;\n                    [self insertPicToDB:url];\n                    }\n                }];\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAfter while taking each picture, I am saving image url in db and then at the same time trying to reload the collection view as well.\n\n```\n- (UICollectionViewCell *)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView cellForItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath{\nstatic NSString *identifier = @\"Cell\";\ncollectionCell = (CollectionCell *)[_collectionView dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier:identifier forIndexPath:indexPath];\ncollectionCell.imageView = (UIImageView*)[collectionCell viewWithTag:100];\ncollectionCell.imageView.image = [UIImage imageNamed:@\"placeholder.png\"];\n    NSString *fileURL = [[recipeImages[indexPath.section] objectAtIndex:indexPath.item] objectForKey:@\"FileUrl\"];\ncollectionCell.imagURL = fileURL;\n    if ([fileURL hasPrefix:@\"assets-library\"]) {\n        [self getImageFromURL:[NSURL URLWithString:fileURL] :indexPath];\n    }else{\n        fileURL = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%@/uploads/thumbnail/%@\",[[HttpClient sharedInstance]getBaseURLString],[[fileURL componentsSeparatedByString:@\"\\\\\"]lastObject]];\n        [collectionCell.imageView setImageWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:fileURL] placeholderImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@\"placeholder.png\"]];\n    }\n    return collectionCell;\n}\n```\n\nSo the condition is, I will keep clicking the pictures and the pictures will be saving in background. \nAnd the definition of method \"getImageFromURL\" is-\n\n```\n-(void)getImageFromURL:(NSURL*)yourUrl :(NSIndexPath*)indexPath{\nALAssetsLibraryAssetForURLResultBlock resultblock = ^(ALAsset *myasset)\n{\n    ALAssetRepresentation *rep = [myasset defaultRepresentation];\n    @autoreleasepool {\n        CGImageRef iref = [rep fullScreenImage];\n        if (iref) {\n            UIImage *image = [UIImage imageWithCGImage:iref];\n            dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{\n                collectionCell = (CollectionCell*)[_collectionView cellForItemAtIndexPath:indexPath];\n                if (collectionCell) {\n                    NSData *imageData = UIImageJPEGRepresentation(image, 0.1);\n                    UIImage *compressedImage = [UIImage imageWithData:imageData];\n                    collectionCell.imageView.image = compressedImage;\n                }else{\n                    collectionCell.imageView.image = nil;\n                }\n                [collectionCell.imageView setNeedsDisplay];\n                [collectionCell setNeedsDisplay];\n            });\n            iref = nil;\n        }\n    }\n};\n\nALAssetsLibraryAccessFailureBlock failureblock  = ^(NSError *myerror)\n{\n    NSLog(@\"Can't get image - %@\",[myerror localizedDescription]);\n};\nALAssetsLibrary* assetslibrary = [[ALAssetsLibrary alloc] init];\n[assetslibrary assetForURL:yourUrl\n               resultBlock:resultblock\n              failureBlock:failureblock];\n}\n```\n\nI am also trying to compress the images while fetching in collection view.

I think this part is correct. _However_ when I return {}, then some problems seems to happen.\n\nBackbone seems to create whole new Backbone models if I return an empty object {} in the parse function.\n\nIn any case, what is the best way to handle different responses from the server in the parse method?\n\nFor example, ss this a good idea?\n\n``` javascript\n  parse: function (resp, options) {\n\n                    if(resp.success){\n                        return resp.success;\n                    }\n                    else{\n                        return this.attributes; /// is this a good idea?\n                    }\n                }\n```\n"

UNEXPECTED (removing model from collection,\n// IMHO should be delayed and done after sucessfull ajax call)\ncollection.on(\"remove\", function (model) {\n  console.log('model removed');\n});\n\nmodel.destroy().always(function () {\n  // Expecting collection length to be 1, as destroy was not succesfull, \n  // but it's 0 - model was removed from collection.\n  // Should I add model back on ajax failure?\n  console.log(collection.length);\n});\n```\n\nLet's compare it with model save. No issue here. Events are tiggered as expected according to docs.\n\n```\nvar MyCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({\n  url: '/collection'\n});\n\n// 1. create instance of collection and model\nvar collection = new MyCollection;\nvar model = new Backbone.Model({\n    id: '1'\n});\n\n// 2. add model to collection\ncollection.add(model);\n\n// 3. this will be fired first - EXPECTED\ncollection.on(\"request\", function (model) {\n  console.log('request');\n});\n\n// 4. this will be never fired as ajax call fails - EXPECTED\ncollection.on(\"sync\", function (model) {\n  console.log('sync');\n});\n\n// 5. this will be fired - EXPECTED\ncollection.on(\"error\", function (model) {\n  console.log('error');\n});\n\nmodel.save().always(function () {\n  console.log(collection.length);\n});\n```\n"

    "body": "Backbone's router is inspired by Ye Olde Routers from several years ago, before single-page applications were a 'thing,' and when one usually reached for a handful of jQuery plugins to build a JavaScript app.\n\nThese routers are distinguished by three characteristics:\n1. Each route is independent from all other routes\n2. Each route is a callback that is triggered when the associated URL is matched\n3. The router is used to bootstrap the page, and is never used again\n\nIt's pretty clear that Backbone's router exhibits the first two characteristics. Over time, changes to the Router have made number 3 a li'l less obvious. The existence of the `trigger` option and the fact that it is `false` by default are evidence of that third characteristic. Numerous blog posts and books always warn _against_ setting `trigger: true`. Additionally, @jashkenas expressed to me that this is how he believed the router should be used when we chatted about it at BBConf a few months ago.\n\nEvery other popular JavaScript library/framework has moved away from this pattern. In its place, a style of routing pioneered by Ember has become the de facto way to structure single page apps. Ember's router went on to heavily influence the React router, Angular's UI Router, and Angular v2's router.\n\nWhile reaching feature parity with Ember's router might be a bit much for Backbone (it would prob. increase the size of the library by 2x lol), I think that looking there for inspiration and coming up with a minimal version of that sort of routing system would tremendously improve Backbone. And I think it could be done in a pretty small amount of code!\n\nFurther, by providing the right hooks, it would make it easier for third party developers to create an Ember-style router for Backbone as a third party library, which is quite the challenge right now (there's more on that at the end of this post).\n\nThese are what I've gathered to be a few of the important characteristics of those routers:\n1. Routes are **states**, and the router is a **state machine**.\n2. Transitions between states are **asynchronous**.\n3. **State** can optionally be encoded into a **URL** when they are transitioned into.\n4. States can have **children states** (this is where a large part of the complexity of Ember-style routing comes from)\n5. Routes, at the minimum, have **two callbacks** associated with them: an **asynchronous** callback and a **synchronous** callback.\n6. A route is activated **each and every time** the URL changes.\n7. **History** is a read/write interface to the browser history, and has no other roles\n# \n\nFAQ for some of those points:\n\n**Why two hooks?**\n\nThere are generally two things you want to do when the URL changes:\n1. Fetch data (maybe)\n2. Render a view (also maybe \u2013\u00a0but most of the time)\n\nGenerally, fetching data is asynchronous, and showing some HTML is synchronous. So, two hooks.\n\n[router.js](https://github.com/tildeio/router.js/) breaks up the async method into three async methods to cover a variety of use cases. This complexity covers important use cases for transitions, but, again, it might be out-of-scope for BB to cover all of those cases. The cool part is that a single hook could be split out into 3 hooks by the plugin authors.\n\n**Why nested routes?**\n\nNesting routes makes it easy to compose nested view states. It also aids with preserving view and data state.\n\nImagine a route called `books`. The URI for this route is also just `books`.\n\nThen imagine two child routes: `book` (with URI `:id`) and `authors` (with URI `authors`).\n\nIf a user is at `books/2`, then `books` and `book` are both active. If the user then navigates over to `books/author`, we wouldn't want to re-fetch all of the data for `books` again! We've already got it! We also probably would not need to render the `books` view again.\n\nThis is just one edge case that the router solves for. As noted above, nested states is most likely far too complicated for Backbone to include. A flat route structure would keep the code small, but the right hooks would allow someone to re-write how routes transition.\n\n**A state machine? Well how come?**\n\nBecause representing many applications as states that the router transitions between truly does simplify things so much. As an added bonus, the router can also be used to manage the state of apps that don't persist their state as a URL, like embedded widgets or whatevs, since encoding state into a URL is optional.\n\n**Why can't you create this this with the current router?**\n\nIt is very difficult right now. There are two main reasons why:\n1. The current router was developed with a different use case in mind, which makes the hooks it provides very bad for this purpose\n2. The roles of history and the router are conflated, I think (to put it another way, backbone's router does not have characteristic 7 of Ember-style routing above)\n\nRecent changes to the `execute` method have been an attempt at resolving the first problem, but they're sort of just band aid solutions over a more fundamental problem.\n\nExamples of roles that History should not do (I think) include:\n1. URL match algorithm [History#loadUrl](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/6541698ff67eaf0a9baf9121cbd22d0f0e90e7b6/backbone.js#L1730-L1740)\n2. Route execution [History#loadUrl](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/6541698ff67eaf0a9baf9121cbd22d0f0e90e7b6/backbone.js#L1730-L1740)\n\nI would argue that the router should manage both of these things, and they should be easily-overridable (and separate) hooks.\n\nI'd be willing to put together a PoC router if there's any interest in something like this in Backbone.\n\nthanx4reading\n"

The exception to this rule is when we talk about list (collection). Image that we have an announcement object with a list of 70,000 of emails that will receive this announcement. If you want just to display the announcement name to the user in the screen, imagine the work that the JPA would have if the 70,000 emails were loaded with the name.\n\nThe JPA created a technology named Lazy Loading to the classes attributes. We could define Lazy Loading by: \u201cthe desired information will be loaded (from database) only when it is needed\u201d.\n\nNotice in the above code, that the database query will return a Sitesobject. When i access the site collection, the container will notice that the  site collection is a lazy attribute and it will \u201cask\u201d the JPA to load this collection from the database.\n\nIn the moment of the query (that will bring the site collection) execution, an exception will happen. When the JPA/Hibernate tries to access the database to get this lazy information, the JPA will notice that there is no opened collection. That is why the exception happens, the lack of an opened database connection.\n\nHere i try many solution but i can't fix this error.\n0/i'm trying to change my filter by the filter bellow but my app don't run:\n\n```\n<filter>\n        <filter-name>Spring OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter</filter-name>\n        <filter-class>org.springframework.orm.jpa.support.OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter</filter-class>\n    </filter>\n    <filter-mapping>\n        <filter-name>Spring OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter</filter-name>\n        <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>\n    </filter-mapping>\n```\n\n1/The easier way to bring a lazy list when the object is loaded is by annotation `@OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)`. But this will not be the best approach always\n2.i am traying to use this annotation @JsonIgnore :solve the lazy error but like the first solution don't work because in the jsp can't displaying value of this list `<td>{{sites.(typesite.idTypeSite)}}</td>`\n\nis there a way to Load collection by Open Session ?\nthank you in advance for you replay\n"

    "body": "I found this issue while investigating why my Collection#get didn't work half of the time.\nI'm fetching the collection from iTunes and I need to use parse both the collection and each model. First fetch (empty collection) works fine, those are keys of the Collection._byId object:\n\n```\n[\"392612116\", \"395544690\", \"429223235\", \"434215319\", \"493267725\", \"704239726\", \"763690325\", \"887944575\", \"982732058\", \"994873600\", \"c1\", \"c2\", \"c3\", \"c4\", \"c5\", \"c6\", \"c7\", \"c8\", \"c9\", \"c10\"]\n```\n\nAs you can see the models are referenced by both the `id` and the `cid` property. It also indicates that  Model#parse was called before the Collection#_addReference, which is the expected behaviour.\n\nAfter fetching the collection second time (no options passed) the Collection._byId is:\n\n```\n[\"c1\", \"c2\", \"c3\", \"c4\", \"c5\", \"c6\", \"c7\", \"c8\", \"c9\", \"c10\"]\n```\n\nSo basically just `cid`s and no `id`.\n\nAfter some investigation I'm assuming that the problem is in the Collection#set method that marks models as duplicate/nonexistent based on the presence of `id` attribute in `attrs` variable:\n\n```\nif (attrs instanceof Model) {\n          id = model = attrs;\n        } else {\n          id = attrs[targetModel.prototype.idAttribute || 'id'];\n        }\n```\n\nThe thing is that attrs have not been parsed by the Model#parse method so the `id` might not exist yet (in my case it doesn't).\n\nThe models are later considered nonexistent because of that and removed:\n\n```\n// Remove nonexistent models if appropriate.\n      if (remove) {\n        for (i = 0, l = this.length; i < l; ++i) {\n          if (!modelMap[(model = this.models[i]).cid]) toRemove.push(model);\n        }\n        if (toRemove.length) this.remove(toRemove, options);\n      }\n```\n\nPossible fixes might include instantinating the `targetModel` class (or calling it's parse) with `attrs` (for which I'll include pull request later) or mentioning in documentation that the Model#parse method should not touch the `id`.\n"

I faced a strange issue when executing a Backbone app on a rather ancient browser (Opera 9.8) some of the routes were not being registered in the browser history. With a little research saw that this would only happen in the following scenario:\n- user interaction\n- ajax request\n- ajax callback handler that executes a `router.navigate`\n\nIn this cases **the url did change**, the app **could navigate to that route** but it **doesn't update the browser history**, hence the user can't navigate back.\n\nThis had the smell of a browser bug, created an small demo and bingo, this happens with just updating `document.location.hash` on a ajax request handler, here is [the SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30457126/change-history-after-async-ajax-request-on-opera-9-8) with that situation.\n\nLooking for a fix for this I found that if I use `document.href` instead of `document.location.hash` on the [Backbone.history._updateHash](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/61d18408addb54f4af4d3e14b0d47111ef94de99/backbone.js#L1796-L1804) method it works:\n\n``` javascript\nBackbone.history._updateHash = function(location, fragment, replace) {\n  var href = location.href.replace(/(javascript:|#).*$/, '');\n  var url = href + \"#\" + fragment;\n  if (replace) {\n    location.replace(url); \n  } else {\n    location.href = url;\n  }\n};\n```\n\nApp testing are green and looks like my problem it's solved, but I've some question:\n1. Is this a new issue? Although I couldn't find anything regarding this it's strange that no one experience this before\n2. Is it safe to override a Backbone method the way I did? I see that preceding `_` on the method name so I assume that this wasn't designed to override.\n3. Should this be fixed in Backbone instead? If that is the case I could do a PR.\n4. Is there any alternative workaround that you can think of?\n\nThank you\n"

On reflection I don't think it's a bug but I wanted to let you know about it so you can decide if you want to do anything about it.\n1. I have a Collection that defines a comparator.\n2. I add an 'add' event handler to the collection that will create a new view for the new model, render it and add it to the DOM.\n3. I populate the collection with multiple models either by calling `Collection.set([model1, model2], {sort: true})` or by calling `Collection.fetch({sort: true})`.\n4. The collection is populated and sorted correctly BUT\n5. The 'add' events are raised in the original order that the models are passed to the collection, not the sorted order.\n\nIn my own code I have worked around this by calling `Collection.reset` instead of `Collection.set` (or when fetching, doing `Collection.fetch({reset: true, sort: true})` instead).\n\nI have created a JS Bin that demonstrates this: http://jsbin.com/voquvicoli/1/edit?html,js,output \n\nHope you don't mind but I also created a blog post describing the behaviour so that if anyone else encountered it they would know to use 'reset' instead of 'set': http://can-we-code-it.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/add-and-reset-events-from-backbone.html\n"

Under 1.1.2, we've used listenTo() to listen for these events from the editor session.\n\nUsing the 1.2.0 release, listenTo() does not appear to be able to listen for these events; they're emitted, and the editor session is present in the View's _listeningTo, but the callback is no longer fired.\n\nWe were using listenTo() for automatic cleanup of the listener function.  Curious if this was never supposed to work in this manner, or if it's a bug.  The changes to listening in 1.2.0 are quite extensive, so it's a bit difficult to see what might be the key difference for one unfamiliar with them.\n"

    "body": "With the final changes to the ES6 class spec (details [here](http://www.2ality.com/2015/02/es6-classes-final.html)), it's no longer possible to use ES6 classes with Backbone without making significant compromises in terms of syntax.  I've written a full description of the situation [here](http://benmccormick.org/2015/04/07/es6-classes-and-backbone-js/) (make sure to click through to the comments at the bottom for an additional mitigating option), but essentially there is no way to add properties to an instance of a subclass prior to the subclasses parents constructor being run.\n\nSo this:\n\n``` javascript\nclass DocumentRow extends Backbone.View {\n\n    constructor() {\n        this.tagName =  \"li\";\n        this.className = \"document-row\";\n        this.events = {\n            \"click .icon\":          \"open\",\n            \"click .button.edit\":   \"openEditDialog\",\n            \"click .button.delete\": \"destroy\"\n        };\n        super();\n    }\n\n    initialize() {\n        this.listenTo(this.model, \"change\", this.render);\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        //...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nis no longer valid in the final ES6 spec.  Instead you effectively have 3 (not very appealing) options if you want to try to make this work:\n\n<h2 id=\"methods\">Attach all properties as functions</h2>\n\n\nBackbone allows this, but it feels dumb to write something like this: \n\n``` javascript\nclass DocumentRow extends Backbone.View {\n\n    tagName() { return \"li\"; }\n\n    className() { return \"document-row\";}\n\n    events() {\n        return {\n            \"click .icon\":          \"open\",\n            \"click .button.edit\":   \"openEditDialog\",\n            \"click .button.delete\": \"destroy\"\n        };\n    }\n\n    initialize() {\n        this.listenTo(this.model, \"change\", this.render);\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        //...\n    }\n}\n```\n\ncompared to the current extends syntax\n## Run the constructor twice\n\nI don't view this as a real option due to the issues it would cause running initialize a second time with different cids, etc.\n\n<h2 id=\"default-options\">Pass all properties as default options to the superclass constructor</h2>\n\n\nThis was suggested by a commenter on my blog and is probably the most practical current option.  It looks something like this:\n\n``` javascript\nclass MyView extends Backbone.View {\n  constructor(options) {\n    _.defaults(options, {\n      // These options are assigned to the instance by Backbone\n      tagName: 'li',\n      className: 'document-row',\n      events: {\n        \"click .icon\": \"open\",\n        \"click .button.edit\": \"openEditDialog\",\n        \"click .button.delete\": \"destroy\"\n      },\n      // This option I'll have to assign to the instance myself\n      foo: 'bar'\n    });\n\n\n    super(options);\n\n\n    this.foo = options.foo;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSince all of these current options involve clear compromises relative to the current Backbone extends syntax, it would be wonderful if a better solution could be developed.  I'm not totally sure what this should look like, but one idea that came to mind while I did the writeup for my blog was the addition of a \"properties\" function that would output a hash of properties. The constructor could then run that function and add them to the instance prior to the other processing done by the constructor.  \n"

Without this authorization header the API will return a 401 which makes the backbone app continue to log the user out of the system.\n\nThe problem starts when i click a tab which triggers a route #guestlist or #ticketlist are the offending routes.  No other routes/actions etc in the system are failing in safari.\n\nIn my sync method I am setting the header if the user is logged into the system and this shows that it is happening.  Here is the output from my logging:\n\n```\nsync :  isAuthenticated = true (backbone.sync.js, line 12)    \nsync: url = http://jcrawford.heytix.com/guestlist/checkin/api/events/13044/guestlist/ (backbone.sync.js, line 13)    \nUser is Authenticated (backbone.sync.js, line 15)    \noptions: {\"parse\":true,\"headers\":{\"Authorization\":\"Token 951ba59c833a80e4ddaf72ee6b3d9143\"}} (backbone.sync.js, line 24)\n```\n\nAny thoughts on why this might be happening solely with Safari?  I have confirmed on the server side (apache log and debugging) that the Authorization header is being sent by Chrome/FireFox but NOT for Safari.  Many more details can be found on the Stack Overflow Question.\n"

    "body": "Currently `listenTo` does not track the event name nor callback in the `_listeningTo` hash.  It only tracks the **other** object.\n\nI would expect the behavior of `stopListening` to only remove the event names + associated callbacks that one object has listened to on another.  But that's not what happens, all callbacks are removed from all objects.\n\nExample:\n\n``` coffeescript\n## Host Model\nhost = new Backbone.Model\n\n## Remote Model 1\n## this object listens to the host model\nremote1 = new Backbone.Model\nremote1.listenTo host, \"setup\", someCallback\n\n## Remove Model 2\n## this object also listens to the host model\nremote2 = new Backbone.Model\nremote2.listenTo host, \"setup\", aDifferentCallback\n```\n\nWhat we've done so far is have 2 remote models listening to the same host model.  They're listening for the same event, but have 2 different callbacks.\n\nNow let's see what happens when `remote1` stops listening to the host model.\n\n``` coffeescript\nremote1.stopListening(host)\n```\n\nOr more specifically, even to the event namespace.\n\n``` coffeescript\nremote1.stopListening(host, \"setup\")\n```\n\nThe same thing happens...\n\n**All listeners** are removed from `host`.  Including the listeners from `remote2` which match the event namespace, or in the case where its omitted, it will remove all listeners.\n\nNow of course you could manually track all of the events and callbacks, and do this\n\n``` coffeescript\nremote1.stopListening(host, \"setup\", someCallback)\n```\n\nBut the defeats the purpose of `listenTo` and `stopListening` to begin with.  These methods automatically track event relationships BETWEEN separate object.  It only makes sense that internally they additionally track the event namespace and the callbacks.  Therefore when `stopListening` occurs, they should only remove **their** associated event listeners from other objects.  \n\nAs it stands, they remove **everything** which matches the host object, and/or the event name.  This obliterates listeners from other objects.\n\nIn my example above, I would expect the listeners for `remote1` to be removed, but the listeners for `remote2` to remain intact.\n\nIf I wanted to remove **all** listeners from the `host` model, I would simply write: \n\n```\nhost.off()\n```\n"

I suspect it's a Chrome bug (and will report it there, as well), but in case anyone else has been tortured by this recently . . .\n\nUsing the slice() method on an array stored as an attribute results in the array values being added to the model, I think as they are being removed:\n\n``` javascript\nvar MyModel = Backbone.Model.extend();\nvar myModel = new MyModel({foo: []});\n\nvar foo1 = myModel.get('foo').slice(0);\nfoo1.push('bar');\nmyModel.set('foo', foo1);\n\nvar foo2 = myModel.get('foo').slice(0);\nfoo2.push('baz');\nmyModel.set('foo', foo2);\n\nvar foo3 = myModel.get('foo').slice(0);\nfoo3.splice(0, 1);\nmyModel.set('foo', foo3);\n\nconsole.log('Fails:', Object.keys(myModel.toJSON()));\n// Prints: Fails: [\"foo\", \"\", \"bar\", \"bar,baz\"]\n```\n\nUsing Array.prototype.slice directly works:\n\n``` javascript\nvar MyModel = Backbone.Model.extend();\nvar myModel = new MyModel({foo: []});\n\nvar foo1 = Array.prototype.slice.call(myModel.get('foo'));\nfoo1.push('bar');\nmyModel.set('foo', foo1);\n\nvar foo2 = Array.prototype.slice.call(myModel.get('foo'));\nfoo2.push('baz');\nmyModel.set('foo', foo2);\n\nvar foo3 = Array.prototype.slice.call(myModel.get('foo'));\nfoo3.splice(0, 1);\nmyModel.set('foo', foo3);\n\nconsole.log('Works:', Object.keys(myModel.toJSON()));\n// Prints: Works: [\"foo\"]\n```\n\nFull example:\n\n``` html\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Broken array values</title>\n  <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.js\" type=\"application/javascript\"></script>\n  <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.8.2/underscore.js\"\n          type=\"application/javascript\"></script>\n  <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/backbone.js/1.1.2/backbone.js\"\n          type=\"application/javascript\"></script>\n  <script type=\"application/javascript\">\n    (function() {\n      var MyModel = Backbone.Model.extend();\n      var myModel = new MyModel({foo: []});\n\n      var foo1 = myModel.get('foo').slice(0);\n      foo1.push('bar');\n      myModel.set('foo', foo1);\n\n      var foo2 = myModel.get('foo').slice(0);\n      foo2.push('baz');\n      myModel.set('foo', foo2);\n\n      var foo3 = myModel.get('foo').slice(0);\n      foo3.splice(0, 1);\n      myModel.set('foo', foo3);\n\n      console.log('Fails:', Object.keys(myModel.toJSON()));\n      // Prints: Fails: [\"foo\", \"\", \"bar\", \"bar,baz\"]\n    })();\n  </script>\n  <script type=\"application/javascript\">\n    (function() {\n      var MyModel = Backbone.Model.extend();\n      var myModel = new MyModel({foo: []});\n\n      var foo1 = Array.prototype.slice.call(myModel.get('foo'));\n      foo1.push('bar');\n      myModel.set('foo', foo1);\n\n      var foo2 = Array.prototype.slice.call(myModel.get('foo'));\n      foo2.push('baz');\n      myModel.set('foo', foo2);\n\n      var foo3 = Array.prototype.slice.call(myModel.get('foo'));\n      foo3.splice(0, 1);\n      myModel.set('foo', foo3);\n\n      console.log('Works:', Object.keys(myModel.toJSON()));\n      // Prints: Works: [\"foo\"]\n    })();\n  </script>\n</head>\n<body>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n"

This technically could be considered a bug in lodash/underscore (@jdalton ?) but released versions of those cause this so we might want to fix it in backbone.\n\nDeferring the `coll.remove` seems like a bad idea so maybe we should just slice the models into a new array when calling `_.each` and `_.forEach`. We could also make `model.destroy` just do all the destroying in a defer?\n\nLet me know what you guys think.\n"

But this doesn't just apply to the listenToOnce. Take a look at the following [example](http://requirebin.com/?gist=8a50edb1123e063fe875). (The example runs Backbone v1.1.2 but the master works the same way).\n\nThe problem is that if the `model` I'm listening to has a listener as well. Then the `view.listeningTo` will not be cleaned up correctly. \n\nIt is because of this [line](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js#L213):\n\n``` javascript\n    if (remove || _.isEmpty(obj._events)) delete this._listeningTo[id];\n```\n\n`obj._events` isn't empty and therefore the `view` will keep its reference to the `model`. Is this correct? In our project this causes problems since the object that is listened to will always have its own listeners and where using `listenToOnce` so the references to the old objects will be kept \"forever\". But we might have to rethink our solution to workaround this issue?\n\n/Albin\n"

Having validation on set is definitely fool-proof, as invalid values can't get passed over and inadvertently remain on a model.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this @jashkenas, I'd love to hear the reasoning why it was reduced to just set. As I'm learning, I've just added the following into my Model.\n\n``` js\n    set: function (key, val, options) {\n        // Handle both `\"key\", value` and `{key: value}` -style arguments.\n        if (typeof key === 'object') {\n            attrs = key;\n            options = val;\n        } else {\n            (attrs = {})[key] = val;\n        }\n\n        options = _.extend({}, options, {\n            validate: true\n        });\n\n        Backbone.Model.prototype.set.call(this, attrs, options);\n    },\n```\n\nThis overrides the behaviour, but to have to do this in every Model will get tiresome.\n"

I am obviously passing `validate` as a function, so where am I supposed to pass `{validate:true}` if it's being defined as a function?\n\nIn general, even though I love this stuff, I feel that the documentation could really benefit from lists of available options for each function (like `Model`) and method (like `set`), that way, a noob could easily ascertain what they can do by default.\n\nHowever, thanks for a great tool.\n"

Since then, the way I think about modularization have changed. This is because it is very decoupled and due to its extension possibilities, facilities to create plug-ins on its top comes out \u2014 it is really easy to get into.\n\nHence, just a few times I used its built-in View layer to design something \u2014 it is barely unnecessary for me and I think it is the weakest point on Backbone. However, it is there: making the library slightly heavier. In other words, in every project I make using Backbone \u2014 almost all \u2014, the Views' layer it's there, dead, waiting an opportunity to be excluded; totally unusable, with dust on its surface.\n\nThen I thought: there is some plan to make it as a \"plug-in\"?

But see: something really easy to attach, but independent.\n\n_DISCLAIMER: This is a question followed by an opinion \u2014 it isn't by far the absolute truth.

    "updated_at": "2015-05-13T21:10:01Z",
    "body": "**Type**: Bug\n\n**Description**: Backbone wipes Collections when 304 responses are returned from the server by calling `set` and/or `reset` on the Collection. Models are parsed, which may be harmless in certain situations, but not all.\n\n**Expected behavior**: Backbone does not empty the collection, and Backbone shouldn't call parse on the model, but still triggers the `sync` event in both situations.\n# \n\n**Wat is this 304 response?**\n\nServers can be configured to return a 304, or \"Not modified,\" response. This response means that the version of the resource that the server has is the same one that you have on the client. This behavior is distinct from client-side caching (which typically means not making an AJAX request at all) and server-side caching (which typically means not hitting the database; sometimes even the application interfacing with the database). Rather, it is more like a handshake between the client and server. For the feature to work according to the specification, both the server and client must be configured appropriately.\n\nThe server must store one of two things for each resource: the time that it was last modified, or an ETag. An ETag is a unique identity for a resource at a given URL. Note again that these are completely independent from arbitrary caching times configured on the server. These modified dates and ETags must reference _specific_ versions of resources.\n\nWhen a request is made by a client, the API will always return the full resource unless one of two headers is passed in: the `If-Last-Modified` header or the `If-None-Matched` header. These headers correspond to the computed last modified timestamp and the ETag value on the server, respectively. The server can use these values to determine whether or not the client has an outdated version of the resource or not.\n\nIf the server determines that the resource has not changed, it returns the 304 response.\n\nSo, who cares, right? Well, the final piece of the 304 response is that it contains an empty body, which is where the problems with Backbone stem from. In this situation the client is supposed to keep the current version of the resource that it has. For more on why this whole process is convenient, [this blog post](http://blogs.telerik.com/fiddler/posts/12-11-05/understanding-http-304-responses) may do a better job at explaining the details.\n# \n\n**So where does Backbone go wrong?**\n\nBackbone goes wrong because it **always** sets the data on a successful callback. Even 304 responses, which return no data. Because of this, collections get wiped due to the behavior of `set`, and Models get `parse` called on them, which is not only inefficient but could reasonably throw errors if you aren't checking for empty responses. Within `parse`, there isn't enough information to determine whether it was a 304 or an actually empty response, so that method should never be relied upon to make the distinction.\n# \n\n**Are there any hooks to prevent this?**\n\nNo, but you can make it work. Backbone [wraps the success callback](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js#L459-L464) you pass in with its own success callback, which is what erases your data. The only way to get around this is to wrap _Backbone's_ wrapped method by overriding `Backbone.$.ajax`, as in [this example](https://github.com/jmeas/gistbook/blob/master/client.src/core/services/resource-cache.js#L16-L32).\n\nThe way that it works is that it updates the empty response with the value that you have cached. It then sets that as the response, so that by the time Backbone's code accesses it, it doesn't even realize that the response was actually empty.\n\nThis is fine from the standpoint of functionality, but it still causes unnecessary code to be executed, such as `set` and `parse`. Ideally nothing happens other than Backbone saying 'ok ur good' and firing the success callbacks.\n# \n\n**Can we see an example?**\n\nIn the following example, we use jQuery's `ifModified` option to configure jQuery to automatically manage our caching for us. This means that jQuery will automatically send the appropriate `If-` headers along with every request. In other words, it handles the client's side of things for us.\n\nWe also use Github's API, which [is configured](https://developer.github.com/v3/#conditional-requests) to manage the server's role in this feature.\n\nWe can see that Backbone wipes the collection after the second fetch, wherein the server informs us that our resource is up-to-date.\n\n``` js\n// Configure jQuery\nBackbone.$.ajaxSetup({ ifModified: true });\n\n// Define and instantiate a collection\nvar Gists = Backbone.Collection.extend({ url: 'https://api.github.com/users/jmeas/gists' });\nvar gists = new Gists();\n\n// Fetch it twice and log the length after each fetch\ngists.fetch().then(function() {\n  // This logs 28\n  console.log('First fetch:', gists.length);\n  gists.fetch().then(function() {\n    // This logs 0\n    console.log('Second fetch:', gists.length);\n  });\n});\n```\n\nBy switching things up a bit, we can create a Model that has parse called (unnecessarily). In this situation, there is no problem; the data remains. But if your parse function isn't checking for 304 responses (I don't think that it should), then you might calculate some incorrect data.\n\n``` js\n// Configure jQuery\nBackbone.$.ajaxSetup({ ifModified: true });\n\n// Define and instantiate our model w. parse\nvar Model = Backbone.Model.extend({\n  url: 'https://api.github.com/gists/026b3b6b90b498d8bb09',\n  parse: function(data) {\n    console.log('parse has been called');\n    return data;\n  }\n});\nvar model = new Model();\n\n// Fetch it twice and log the attributes after each fetch\nmodel.fetch().then(function() {\n  console.log('First fetch:', model.attributes);\n  model.fetch().then(function() {\n    console.log('Second fetch:', model.attributes);\n  });\n});\n```\n# \n\n**How can we fix this?**\n\nOne idea is to revert d04b0f793b95ea which reverted ea24e0a2 which was PRed in #3410\n\nIn that PR, @braddunbar gives a counter-example where he shows Backbone appearing to be functioning correctly. The issue with that example is twofold:\n1. The server is not following any specification. It should only return a 304 if the resource hasn't changed based on the `If-X` headers, not arbitrary caching times. The correct response in that situation is a 200 response + the data, as if the caching layer didn't exist.\n2. Even so, had the server returned a correct 304 response, it should have been empty. It's not unreasonable to conceive of situations where this could cause a `parse` method to error out or otherwise calculate an incorrect value.\n\n**Other concerns with that PR**\n\nThat PR requires a specific convention with using models, which is that once a model is created it cannot be destroyed.\n\nThe reason for this is that the PR does not provide any new hooks to fetch data from a cache. Rather, it assumes that the current version of the model still has the data from the last fetch. Because jQuery fetches by URI, if I get rid of my Model instance, or otherwise make a new one, I will be unable to get new data for that model unless I reference the original model (or some external cache).\n\nThis is fine for my apps, as this is how I use Backbone, but maybe there are folks out there who are destroying and instantiating models that all point to the same URI.\n"

    "body": "Looking at the changes that occurred to fix saving when wait: true from 0.9.0 to 0.9.1 (https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/commit/ec61503c874ebbb147595e5ded86601164b54002) I understand that the expected behavior is not working, however I am unsure that the correct fix was implemented.\n\nI would assume the expected behavior is that in saving a model with `wait: true`, the attributes should not be touched in any way until after the backend responds. The current behavior temporarily sets the attributes property of the model with the new attributes, sets up the asynchronous call and then resets the attributes. \n\nThis all looks fine and good, and when looking at the progression of code, the initial fix was solidified and given a home, but I believe some interesting inconsistencies were introduced. Namely, since the `isNew()` and `sync()` methods are available via the model prototype and can be overridden I technically can have access to model attributes that are invalid/not yet saved.\n\nUse Case:\nI use the \"name\" attribute, as well as the ID attribute, to determine if the model `isNew`:\n\n```\nreturn !this.get( 'name' ) && Backbone.Model.prototype.isNew.call( this );\n```\n\nIf I save in this fashion:\n\n```\nthis.save( { name: 'foo' }, { wait: true } );\n```\n\nMy `isNew` method will evaluate to `false` since name will have been temporarily saved to the changing value to synchronize, thus calling an update and not a post to occur. I realize this examples relies on stretching the intent of `isNew()` but I believe it best exemplifies the issue.\n\nI think that if `wait: true` is used cloning, via extend, the model's attributes with the passed in attributes and sending those to the `sync` call via `options` would be preferred:\n\n```\nif ( attrs && options.wait ) {\n   options.attrs = _.extend( {}, this.toJSON( options ), attrs );\n}\n```\n\nI realize that there are probably some theoretical and fundamental reasons (ie: you shouldn't be using save with attributes on new models) why this is not how the implementation was made. I would love to better understand them. However, I do not think it is appropriate that I have prototype methods that can be overridden that can see attributes on the model which I told via `wait: true` to not be set until after I heard back from the backend.\n"

It actually happens whenever the `model` function lacks a `prototype` property. For example: \n\n```\nvar myCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({ \n    initialize: function() { \n        this.model.prototype = null;\n    }, \n\n    model: function(attrs, options) { \n        return new Backbone.Model(attrs, options); \n    }\n});\n\nnew myCollection([{ a: 1 }]); \n```\n\nBackbone errors on this line https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js#L939 because `prototype` doesn't exist. \n\nObviously, few people would write `this.model.prototype = null`, but a lot of people might write `this.model = _.bind(this.model)`, which also removes the prototype. Backbone should be able to handle this case.\n\nIt seems like it'd be pretty straightforward to have line 939 also check for the existence of `prototype`. What do you think? \n"

In other words, its `comparator` is `'name'`. \n\n_Model behaviour_: If we take one of the collection's models and `set` the `name` attribute, the collection will not be re-sorted and no `sort` event will be triggered. This is well explained in the documentation.\n\n_Collection behaviour_: Now, if we take the collection as a whole and call `set` on it, passing it the existing model but with a modified `name`, it will indeed re-sort the collection and trigger a `sort` event; refer to the following line:\n\n``` javascript\nif (sortable && !sort && existing.hasChanged(sortAttr)) sort = true;\n```\n\nIs this intended?

I am a bit eccentric and want full control of the whole life-cycle in order to be able to implement [shouldComponentUpdate](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html#updating-shouldcomponentupdate) in a proper way.\n\nThe problem I am having is that Backbone sends a reference of the collection when the 'add' event is triggered (just one example, there might be other events with similar problems) but since all references are \"byRef\" and the event is not synchronous I do not get a valid representation of the collection. Instead; I get the collection when all items have been added (given that the time to add goes faster than triggering the events).\nI.e. when I fetch a list of 10 items I get the following back on my listener:\n\n```\n[\n    <model: the item that was added>,\n    <collection: all 10 items, even on the first one>,\n    <options: saying that the index of the added item is 0, on every event>\n]\n```\n\nWould I be breaking any principles by asking for a copy of the collection instead of a reference to it?\n\n```\nvar before = _.deepClone(this);   \n...   \ntrigger('add', before, options);\n```\n\nKind regards,\nMartin\n"

This relates a\nbit to #1451, #1912, #1843, and specially #2842, where @akre54 said:\n\n> Another good option is passing a flag, or testing for the existence of some\n> property to determine the context (collection or model) in your model's parse\n> method.\n\nI agree with that, the problem is that, unless I'm mistaken, is not there by\ndefault, and there is no reason why It should not be. The documentation of\nModel#parse says:\n\n> **parse** is called whenever a model's data is returned by the server, in\n> fetch, and save. The function is passed the raw response object, (...)\n\nWell, that's not correct. :-)\n\nMy server has the real content inside the \"data\" key of the response body, so I\nneed to override parse. If in the model I set parse() to `return response.data`\nthat works for the model getting its own data from the server, but\nwhen the collection hands the parsed data to the model, I need to check\nsomething in `options` to know whether I'm reading the data handed out from the\nserver (Model#fetch) or handed out from the collection (Collection#fetch),\nbecause the parsing is different.\n\nAt first glance, I thought you got it covered because I saw options has a\nreference to the collection. The problem is that a second call to fetch (without\nreset) has not such a reference. I fixed it by adding such a flag myself on a\nsync() reimplementation, or peeking on the URL to tell them apart.\n\nI think at least the documentation should be adjusted to explain what one can\nexpect in the options. Ideally, a flag would be better to avoid having to\noverride yet another function.\n\nThank you!\n"

However, I think the issue is on Backbone since the `Backbone.$` is undefined.\n\nI went back up to see where Backbone is coming from on the Marionette side :\n\n``` js\nif (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd) {\n    define(['backbone', 'underscore', 'backbone.wreqr', 'backbone.babysitter'], function(Backbone, _) {\n      return (root.Marionette = factory(root, Backbone, _));\n    });\n  } else if (typeof exports !== 'undefined') {\n    var Backbone = require('backbone'); // Backbone is defined here!\n    var _ = require('underscore');\n    var Wreqr = require('backbone.wreqr');\n    var BabySitter = require('backbone.babysitter');\n    module.exports = factory(root, Backbone, _);\n  } else {\n    root.Marionette = factory(root, root.Backbone, root._);\n  }\n```\n\nIt looks like it's grabing a new instance of Backbone and not the one I added earlier with the $ defined.\n\nKnowing this, I dive into Backbone.js to find this :\n\n``` js\nfunction(root, Backbone, _, $) {\n\n  // Initial Setup\n  // -------------\n\n  [...]\n\n  // For Backbone's purposes, jQuery, Zepto, Ender, or My Library (kidding) owns\n  // the `$` variable.\n  Backbone.$ = $;\n```\n\nand the `$` is ~~defined~~ undefined here :\n\n``` js\n// Next for Node.js or CommonJS. jQuery may not be needed as a module.\n  } else if (typeof exports !== 'undefined') {\n    var _ = require('underscore');\n    factory(root, exports, _);\n```\n\nIf I add `$` like so\n\n``` js\n// Next for Node.js or CommonJS. jQuery may not be needed as a module.\n  } else if (typeof exports !== 'undefined') {\n    var _ = require('underscore');\n    factory(root, exports, _, $); // Added $ here!\n```\n\nWith jQuery being pre-required before Backbone on global scope.\n\nIt **will** work since it will be defined on the second init of Backbone and if jQuery is not defined on other projects, it will stay `undefined`.\n\nWhich is similar to #3031!\n\nAm I getting something wrong, sorry I bring up the subject again, but I am not sure how to handle this properly. \n\nThanks :bowtie: \n"

    "body": "Removing `this.option` was a move for the better, I think, but removing it made it more evident that there's really no concise way to specify additional properties to merge directly on a Class \u2013\u00a0which I find to be a pretty basic feature of extending a Class, and almost certainly an action that I do whenever I make a new Class.\n\nLet's consider the case that I make a new View, say, `EditorView`, which accepts a number of additional options on top of what Backbone.View accepts. Let's look at my options for getting those additional options onto the prototype.\n\nIn the most verbose form, I manually attach each additional option to my view.\n\n``` js\nvar EditorView = Backbone.View.extend({\n  constructor: function(options) {\n    this.style = options.style || this.style;\n    this.color = options.color || this.color;\n    this.readOnly = options.readOnly || this.readOnly;\n    this.menu = options.menu || this.menu;\n    this.preview = options.preview || this.preview;\n    Backbone.View.constructor.apply(this, arguments);\n  },\n\n  // set my defaults...\n  this.style = 'tall';\n});\n```\n\nThe primary problem with this approach is how verbose it is...nobody would ever want to write a new line of code for each additional option they pass. So let's take a look at how we can improve this, drawing some inspiration from the Backbone source itself:\n\n``` js\nvar editorOptions = ['style', 'color', 'readOnly', 'menu', 'preview'];\n\nvar EditorView = Backbone.View.extend({\n  constructor: function(options) {\n    _.extend(this, _.pick(options, editorOptions));\n    Backbone.View.constructor.apply(this, arguments);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis is a big improvement, I think, because we now only need to add new values to the `editorOptions` array and they'll be merged, so things are substantially more DRY.\n\nBut I'd still like something _even more_ DRY. As my app grows, the number of Classes I extend grows, too. Eventually, I might find myself with tens or hundreds of Classes, and in each one I must write  `_.extend(this, _.pick(options, myCustomOptions));` within the constructor.\n\nIt's far from the worst line of code ever, but it seems a bit much to need to include this in every Class. I'd consider these additional properties to be a fundamental part of extending an object. And common enough to warrant some additional convenience.\n\nWhat if that array was on the prototype chain, and what if it would automatically be concatenated with the parent's array within the extend method? That would provide us with the following API:\n\n``` js\nvar EditorView = Backbone.View.extend({\n  mergeOptions: ['style', 'color', 'readOnly', 'menu', 'preview']\n});\n\nvar SuperEditorView = EditorView.extend({\n  mergeOptions: ['superProperty']\n});\n```\n\nThis allows one to declaratively specify additional properties to be merged directly on the instance, which would really clean up some code.\n\nSupporting this would involve adding something to the effect of\n\n``` js\nchild.prototype.mergeOptions = _.union(this.prototype.mergeOptions, child.prototype.mergeOptions);\n```\n\nto the extend method.\n\nI can see this being a pretty controversial change, but I figured I'd propose it over here before I go and overwrite extend in my own projects.\n\n(p.s. Yes, I understand that there aren't actually classes in Javascript, but it's tough to argue against the utility in describing Backbone Objects with that word.)\n"

    "body": "Right now, calling `router.navigate('/my-url', myOptions);` doesn't allow one to access `myOptions` later on from within the Router. This is because they're sent away to Backbone.history and are never seen again.\n\nConsequently, if you'd like to add more options, then you must modify not just the Router, but also Backbone.History, which seems like a lot.\n\nWith a small, backwards-compatible change, users can more easily expand the navigation options without touching the Backbone.history object.\n#### Why?\n\nWhat I'm trying to do is make a more powerful Router. One of the features is the ability for a developer to declaratively specify data objects for a specific 'route' \u2013\u00a0which is basically just a matched URL. The data is fetched the first time you navigate to that route, then gets cached for subsequent visits. To reset the cache I'd like to support a new option to `navigate`...maybe something like\n\n``` js\nmyRouter.navigate('/books', {resetCache:true});\n```\n\nThere might be other options I add later, too, that further modify the behavior of what happens when a route is matched.\n#### What's doing this like now?\n\nI have to copy + paste two methods from Backbone.History in addition to the internal regular expressions, which are used by one of the methods. First, I have to modify `History#navigate` to [pass the options to the `loadUrl` method on L1625](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js#L1625). Then I need to override [`loadUrl` to do the same](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js#L1576). It's roughly 50 lines of code, in total, just to add two additional arguments to the callbacks.\n\nIn addition to those changes to Backbone.History, I need to override the [`Router#route` method](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js#L1316) \u2013\u00a0which is really all that I want to do \u2013\u00a0to do something with those options that I get back.\n#### What's the change look like?\n\nPassing `options` as a second parameter to the aforementioned methods of Backbone.History.\n\nLine 1576\n\n``` diff\n- handler.callback(fragment);\n+ handler.callback(fragment, options);\n```\n\nLine 1625\n\n``` diff\n- if (options.trigger) return this.loadUrl(fragment);\n+ if (options.trigger) return this.loadUrl(fragment, options);\n```\n\nBy doing this, I only need to modify `Router.route` to process the additional option, which makes things less fragile. A possible counter-argument is that I shouldn't be using the `navigate` options to expand the functionality of routing to callbacks. If that's the case, how might I go about this instead without getting into the History object?\n"

Especially for the `PATCH` scenario, where I only want to send certain attributes over to the server, and I don't have to override `toJSON` - as that should be left for the case of sending a complete representation to the server (which  my app also does).\n\nHowever, I ran into a problem. Because of this line: https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js#L499 it appears that any `attrs` you pass to `save()` are going to get `set()` on the model. So in this instance, `attrs` are snake_cased, but `serverAttrs` (which have just been run through `parse()`) are camelCased.\n\nI'm not sure if this is something backbone should support, but it feels fairly common to need to transform keys between the client and the server, and I don't think `toJSON` is always the place, because that completely takes away true `PATCH` support (where you want to send a partial version of the model).\n\nAn easy fix would be to simply run `parse()` on the new extended object, rather than just on `serverAttrs` - but I suppose that could have a few potential problems with it too, such as re-modifying an existing value, or something. I don't know....\n\nAny ideas/comments?\n\nThanks!\n"

    "title": "listenToOnce creates unexpected memory leak in _listeningTo object",
    "created_at": "2014-07-18T16:17:50Z",
    "updated_at": "2014-10-20T17:20:08Z",
    "body": "When using `listenToOnce`, I\u2019d expect that post-trigger, I\u2019d be free of associations between my listener and my object, much like when calling `once`. However, even though the event listener cleans up, the object reference is still maintained through the `_listeningTo` object. This has potential to create unexpected memory leaks.\n#### An Example\n\nA parent view creates a child view that acts as a modal. I have the parent view `listenToOnce` for a close event on the children views. This is the only event the parent is listening for on the child. That close event fires once and the parent view callback is satisfied. The child view has `.remove()` performed and everything is thought to be cleaned up. The child view is not able to be gc\u2019d though because the parent still has a reference in `_listeningTo`. In a case of a long living parent view, this can become  a incremental leak as I perform more view creations.\n\nAs a normal backbone user, I have no idea that a reference is maintained to the object being listened to. This would be my expectation when there are no more events being watched. I don't know that I need to perform `stopListening` manually.\n#### Proposal\n\nDifferentiate `listenToOnce` from `listenTo`. Let `listenToOnce` perform a `stopListening(childView, event)` when the callback is executed\u2026 thereby removing the association if it was the only event being watched.\n\nMy very inelegant solution which strikes at the crux of the problem:\n\n``` javascript\n  var listenMethods = {listenTo: 'on', listenToOnce: 'once'};\n\n  // Inversion-of-control versions of `on` and `once`. Tell *this* object to\n  // listen to an event in another object ... keeping track of what it's\n  // listening to.\n  _.each(listenMethods, function(implementation, method) {\n    Events[method] = function(obj, name, callback) {\n      var listeningTo = this._listeningTo || (this._listeningTo = {});\n      var id = obj._listenId || (obj._listenId = _.uniqueId('l'));\n      listeningTo[id] = obj;\n      if (!callback && typeof name === 'object') callback = this;\n\n      // solution begins here\n      if (implementation === 'once') {\n        cachedCallback = callback;\n        callback = function () {\n          this.stopListening(obj, name);\n          return cachedCallback.apply(this, arguments);\n        }\n      }\n\n      obj[implementation](name, callback, this);\n      return this;\n    };\n  });\n```\n\nThoughts?\n"

Right now, since I cannot listen to a collection's attributes' events, I just manually set currentSong and call `updateSongInfo()`. Now that I've learned the basics of Backbone more clearly, I want to do this more naturally from `PlaylistView` by listening to events. One alternative that I thought of was moving the attributes to a different model (e.g. MusicPlayer) and setting `Playlist` collection as the model's attribute like `MusicPlayer.Playlist = new ()..`.\n\nExtra info: I built a chrome extension [Instant Music](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/instant-music/ehebnoicojclpjjblbacdjmpjpkocmml) to learn Backbone for the first time and now I am in the middle of refactoring it to make the code less awful.\n\nThis [issue](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/1442) from the past might be related.\n\nUpdate: I just ran across [FAQ-nested](http://documentcloud.github.io/backbone/#FAQ-nested).

Furthermore, this speedup could be achieved by users without having to modify their code at all.\n\nIt may also be worth considering modifying the `Collection.set` method to offer O(n) insertion into sorted collections, as opposed to O(n lg n) currently achieved by re-sorting the entire collection. The main downside to this idea is that it may be slower if inserting many Models, not just one, because the collection is only re-sorted once in that case - so I think I will put this off in the meantime.\n\nIf I were to submit a pull request, would this be considered a desirable feature?\n"

Long urls like /boards/1/lists/2/cards/2 are ugly.\n\nRails even has some syntactic sugar for this `:shallow => true`\nhttp://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#nested-resources\n\nI propose a new check at the top of Model::url that will check the shallowApi property, then use the shallowUrl method to calculate the url and return.

    "body": "There is a strange behavior in our application where under certain conditions; the history is incorrectly changed during popstate.\n\nThe scenario is the following:\n\nFirst, History's navigate() is called with an encoded fragment. Per the documentation:\n\n```\n//  You are responsible for properly URL-encoding the fragment in advance.\nnavigate: function(fragment, options) {}\n```\n\nWe can then see that the fragment is stored on the history object:\n\n```\nthis.fragment = fragment;\n```\n\n... so we understand this.fragment holds an encoded path string.\n\nIn the case of pushState, a listener is added to the popstate event which fires checkUrl():\n\n```\naddEventListener('popstate', this.checkUrl, false);\n```\n\nWhen fired, the listener (checkUrl) responds:\n\n```\n// Checks the current URL to see if it has changed, and if it has, calls `loadUrl`\ncheckUrl: function(e) {\n      var current = this.getFragment();\n      .\n      .\n      if (current === this.fragment) return false;\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, backbone does a check to make sure the url has not changed, so loadUrl should not get called. \n\nHowever, the getFragment() function always returns a DECODED string, because decodeURI() is called on the location. i.e.:\n\n```\nif ('shop/search?keyword=short dress' === 'shop/search?keyword=short%20dress') {\n  // will never execute\n}\n```\n\nTherefore, this boolean if (current === this.fragment) does not evaluate to TRUE, and loadUrl() is incorrectly called - causing errors in our application (e.g. items removed from pushState history when they should not be).\n\nIf I call navigate() without encoding the uri, this condition will correctly execute, but there is the potential of an invalid url if special characters exist in the fragment.\n\nI see this issue exists in stable 1.1.2 (which is what we are using), as well as the current master. There is a slight difference in getFragment(), but even in the latest code, decodeURI() is called before checking against the encoded fragment stored in the context of navigate().\n\nI see that checkUrl() and getFragment() are called everywhere, and I'm certain that decodeURI() is happening for a reason. But it seems this case was not considered.\n\nThoughts?\n"

Imagine I have a single query parameter with an arbitrary value that happens to contain \"1&bar=2\".\nSo I construct my fragment string like so:\n\nvar value = encodeURIComponent(\"1&bar=2\");\nrouter.navigate(\"foo=\" + value);\n\nWhen I refresh the page and my onQueryRoute event handler gets called, I will receive this string: \"foo=1&bar=2\", which is obviously impossible to parse now because it can be interpreted as two\nquery parameters when it should actually only be one. This is happening because on line 1306 inside of _extractParamters(), you are url-decoding the _whole_ fragment hash without splitting it first.\n\nIn my particular use-case, the query parameters are not fixed; there can be an arbitrary number of them so I can't easily set a route regex that automatically parses the individual values. The structure of my URL is like this: key1[0]=value1&key2[0]=value2&key1[1]=...&foo=bar&baz=blah\n\nThe execute() preprocessor method is useless here because it gets called _after_ _extractParameters() has mangled the hash string by url-decoding it whole without splitting it first by default.

If `Backbone.history` has not yet been updated, **I don't see any way to access the hash** in order to push it onto the history stack.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the simplest workaround is to add a `fragment` parameter to execute, right after the `name` parameter. Another option would be to roll the `name` and `fragment` into an `options` object. With the later solution, we could additionally add an `options` parameter to `loadUrl()` that could be mixed in to the `options` object passed to `execute()`. This could potentially add greater flexibility for extending how routes are handled. If either of these solutions sound reasonable, I can submit a pull request.\n"

Maybe my design is flawed to begin with, but here's an analogy:\n\nLocation = Backbone.Model.extend({\n    initialize: function() {\n        this.on('change:city', this._updateState, this);\n        this.on('change:state', this._updateCity, this);\n    },\n\n```\n_updateState: function() {\n    // Avoid causing recursion.\n    if (this.hasChanged('state')) return;\n\n    this.set('state', stateForCity(this.get('city')));\n},\n\n_updateCity: function() {\n    // Avoid causing recursion.\n    if (this.hasChanged('city')) return;\n\n    this.set('city', citiesForState(this.get('state'))[0]);\n}\n```\n\n});\n\nThis allows:\n\n1 - listeners who only care about one or the other to listen directly to that attribute's \"change\" event\n2 - avoid computing values more than once\n3 - the user can change either one and the other will get updated appropriately\n\nIs there a better design pattern for something like this?  I could store a `'cityState'` property as `{city: 'Houston', state: 'TX'}`, but then I would have to do my own change detection... `model.previous('cityState').state == model.get('cityState').state`\n"

Using PUT, the whole representation of the resource is sent, no partial update allowed. The resource is overwritten in the database.\n\nSo why in the default CRUD to HTTP method mapping of Backbone, a CREATE operation is mapped to the HTTP POST method and an UPDATE operation to a HTTP POST method ? I am not an expert of REST, but shouldn't it be the opposite ? Are there any other considerations that led to this mapping ?\n\nThanks for your feedback !\n"

And if it is intended to be used as the restful endpoint identifier, you'd presumably be sending that as the id from the server in the first place.\n\n@caseywebdev just wanted to get your opinions on this, is this something you've run into in the situations you've used it in?

As it is now, if you were to unset an attribute, Backbone will hold a reference to the old attribute value. This can have memory implications and security implications (consider someone setting a sensitive piece of information that is unset later, then it may still easily be accessible to an attacker that has found an XSS).

The prototype chain of Javascript seems to a built-in way to implement this.\n\nThis `Mediator`/`Proxy` object would be somehow instanciated in my overriden impl of my View ctor and replace the original `this.model`, the view being given in its options hash the mapping defined above, as a hash object, which values would be attribute names or even maybe functions to deal with logic like concatenation of firstName + lastName. _In the rest of the code of my view, i only have to deal with `this.model` just as it were a Model with \"native\" `displayName`, `shortDesc` and `previewThumbnail` attributes_.\n\nThis is roughly the idea i have at the moment... Some outlines but not a clear idea of the whole thing... I'd also like this to work with collections.\n\nHow would you implement that (attribute aliases for my observed/pointed model without modifying the original models definitions) ? Are there plugins you know that provide such a feature? Would the ES6 Proxy object be helful in the future or has it nothing to do with my request ?\n\nThanks in advance for your feedback and ideas !\n"

But this is not always the case. In this above example, the unique identifier is the username, and so the ID is provided.\n\nBut that code will always try to do a PUT request on /userapi/v0idnull and it will always fail with a 404.\n\nI think there are many different ways of solving this, from providing create() and update() methods on the model (that save() can use), to changing\n\n``` javascript\nmethod = this.isNew() ? 'create' : (options.patch ? 'patch' : 'update');\n```\n\nto exposing the method through the options hash of the save() method:\n\n``` javascript\nmethod = options.method ? options.method : (this.isNew() ? 'create' : (options.patch ? 'patch' : 'update');\n```\n\nWith a change like this, I can do one of two things:\n\nMy application is aware of when I'm creating a user and when I'm updating a user and call the appropriate method / set the appropriate option\n\nOR\n\nI call save normally which tries a PUT, gets a 404, and an error handler tries save again, forcing a POST.\n\nThoughts?\n"

Why is this one more convenient imho ? Because it allows the collection to listenToOnce(removeModel, 'sync error', ...) when one of its model is removed from the collection, a convenient way to deal with issues such as https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/935 and https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/2692, in other words : keep watching for success or failure of DELETE operation in the backend of the removed model from the Collection, no matter if you're simulating a backend with a synchronous impl of sync or working with the real backend and its latency.\n\nIf i am right and if you agree with me, the end of the impl of model.destroy should be fixed.\n\nWhat is your opinion ?\n"

However, I don't want to change the type of the to \"RecordSummary\", because I still have a full Record.\n\nIf I use Collection.add, with merge:true, Backbone will overwrite the type of my Record to \"RecordSummary\", and there's (currently) no good way to change that behavior.\n\nHowever, if this line (which comes right after \"if (options.merge)\" in Collection.set):\n\n```\nexisting.set(model.attributes, options);\n```\n\nwas refactored in to a method:\n\n```\nthis.setMerge(existing, model.attributes, options);\n\n...\n\nsetMerge: function(existing, attributes, options) {\n    existing.set(attributes, options);\n}\n```\n\nThen users could override setMerge to add any special merge behavior they like, such as:\n\n```\nsetMerge: function(existing, attributes, options) {\n    existing.set(_(attributes).exclude('type'), options);\n}\n```\n\nOf course, the utility of this refactoring would not be limited to this case; it could be used for any sort of merge-specific behavior override.\n\nGiven that, and given that the refactoring itself is trivial, is there any chance something like this might make it in to Backbone (or is there any other way to solve this sort of problem that already exists)?\n\nP.S. If this change is desired I'd be happy to submit a pull request.\n"

Getting the full fragment with query is very useful. I know It can be manually parsed from the URL but then you have to worry about if **pushState** is on and whatever other options effect how Backbone.history works. So I find it would be best to get it directly from `Backbone.history`.\n\nThe fix could be as simple as keeping a reference called something like **Backbone.history.queryfragment** (or whatever name makes most sense) and storing a reference just before replacing with `pathStripper`\n\nI would be interested doing a PR for this.

Currently, we have a custom `sync` that does this:\n\n``` javascript\nsync: function(method, model, options) {\n\n  var xhr = Model.prototype.sync.apply(this, arguments);\n\n  var collection = model.collection;\n  if (method === 'create' && collection) {\n    collection.trigger('create', model, collection, xhr, options);\n  }\n\n  return xhr;\n}\n```\n"

    "body": "Because both `id` and `cid` are used as the keys of `_byId`, there's an implicit assumption that no model's `id` will equal the `cid` of any other model in the same collection. Breaking this assumption causes very strange behavior:\n\n```\nvar model1 = new Backbone.Model()  // model1.cid = 'c1'\nvar model2 = new Backbone.Model({id: 'c1'})\nvar collection1 = new Backbone.Collection([model1, model2])\nvar collection2 = new Backbone.Collection([model2, model1])\n```\n\nIn this case, `collection1` will only contain `model1`, and `collection2` will only contain `model2`.\n\nThis doesn't seem like an unrealistic edge case to me. I think the `_byId` hash should be broken up into separate `_byId` and `_byCid` hashes, with the `Collection::get` behavior made explicit to favor ids over cids:\n\n```\nreturn this._byId[obj] || this._byCid[obj] || this._byId[obj.id] || this._byCid[obj.cid];\n```\n"

    "body": "Hello, \n\nwe are having problems with the new backbone version concerning the new policy of to use \"idAttribute\". Before we use always \"this.id\" in \"parse\" and it was working correctly but now it is not working, so we are changing all our models to \"idAttribute\" but we found some strange behaviours. E.G. : \n\nWe have a model with three attributes {code=\"\",label=\"\",text=\"\"} where \"idAttribute=code\". To create new elements we have a form where the user add this three attributes, but when we try to save it, Backbone realizes a PUT instead of a POST, because when I set the \"code\" Backbone also set the \"this.id\" so the model never is new and it cant be POST. How can we use \"idAttribute\" in models that the \"id\" is not generated by the server but it is added from the user in a form?\n\nOther problem with \"idAttribute\" is when we need to have a composed id. After we set the \"this.id\" in the parse and this don't affect the attributes, but now this don't work. So we have to set the \"response.id\" in parse in order to Backbone treat it, but then we have \"id\" in the attributes and we don't want it, because the rest don't accept this attribute because the \"id\" is only used in the url.\n\nWhat can we do in this case?\n\nI think this last update about \"idAttribute\" have more limitations than benefits.   \n"

This is to give consistency to all the urls.\n\nThis then becomes an issue as backbonejs when creating the url for the model doesn't place a tailing `/` to the url. Therefore the server will respond with a 301 redirect then the client needs to follow the redirect. This adds latency to the system.\n\nI am sure other projects do the same thing as Ghost. I suggest adding a setting in backbone where you can set to add a tailing `/` to all api urls.\n\nI suggest that the url function return is passed through another function to add or remove a tailing slash if needed.\n\nDo you want me do fork this and create a working proof of concept?\n"

I did search the issues, but nothing seemed to address this.\n\nOur app has been developed using Backbone.router in hashChange mode (that is, without pushState:true), in order to support older browsers.  The Backbone doc seems to say that pushState-mode and hashChange-mode will work the same way, but they do not.  \n\nIn particular, we can't seem to avoid triggering a route every time we call router.navigate(). Adding {trigger:false} is ineffective in this case, and anyway 'false' is meant to be the default.  I find nothing in the doc that warns about this; there are only a bunch of reassurances that pushState and hashChange modes work exactly the same.  \n\nIt took us a while to understand what was happening.  There is, by definition, no way to avoid triggering the hashchange event when changing the hash part of the URL.  Our local solution would be to wrap Backbone.navigate() and Backbone.checkUrl(), to first set and then clear some kind of ignore-one-hashchange-event flag, so that the hashchange event triggered by navigate() is silently ignored.  This approach could be added direct to Backbone; i'd gladly contribute the code if it's a good idea.\n\nOn the other hand, I can't believe we're the only ones with this problem, and I wonder if we're just doing something wrong.\n\nAny advice appreciated.  But in particular: shouldn't we be able to call navigate() without triggering a route?  Or is that somehow incorrect or undesirable?\n\nThanks,\n-mykle-\n"

For example, when implementing a custom select box, the developer will want to close the select area when a click happens anywhere else.\n\nIt is currently possible by overloading the `delegateEvents` and `undelegateEvents` methods to manually attach and detach these events; however, this approach is a bit complex and more error-prone than standard `events` mapping.\n\nMy proposal would be to allow a special tag which would basically say that we don't want to stay in the scope of the view. If we take the select box example, we could have this kind of event definition :\n\n``` js\nBackbone.View.extend( {\n    events : {\n        'click .toggle' : 'toggleEvent',\n        'click @global body' : 'closeEvent'\n    }\n} );\n```\n\nSuch thing would have multiple benefits :\n- It would allow an **easy global event handling** (which is the whole point ;)\n- It would **not break backward compatibility**, neither mess with jQuery / Sizzle\n- It would be **self-documented**, a reader would immediately know that the selector is not view-limited\n\nIt would have those inconvenients :\n- **A bit more code** to check if the selector starts by this keyword, but I don't think that performances would be very affected by an `indexOf` call (especially with Harmony's `String#startsWith`)\n- Some developers could be **encouraged to use global event instead of view-limited ones** without good reason. However, the same thing can be sayed for almost everything, and using a keyword such as `@global` allows to be sure that the developer is aware of the implications.\n\nI can write a draft implementation if you wish.\n"

Totally not cool.\n\nIn [Backbone's fork Exoskeleton](http://exosjs.com) we (w @akre54) decided to try dropping all dependencies and it worked out very well. Instead of including 40K of gzipped JavaScript, you just need to include 8K \u2014 that's **five times less**! Very noticeable on shitty 2-2.5-3G networks\n\nBut the most important part of dropping jQuery and relying on native methods is the performance. Apps I develop are usually complex and interacting with DOM natively allows to increase speed from **5 to 12 times** on Chrome. _Proofs are on the website_.\n\n**DOM is a total bottleneck** and it is unfortunate that jQuery slows it down by several magnitudes. On mobile devices this is even a bigger deal since they are slow.\n\nWould you be interested in dropping these dependencies? Maybe just jQuery?\n\nTo all folks who may defend the status quo: it's cool.

    "body": "The parse semantics for model and collection is somewhat confusing.\n\nSuppose one provides a custom parse for  collection and model to deal with the raw response.  e.g. response from server is always in the form  {'success': true/false,  data: {..}/\"error_msg\"}\n\nNow model.fetch would work fine as the parse method will be able to parse correctly.\nHowever the `collection.fetch` would fail, in this case the first `collection.parse` will be able to parse the response correctly and return a list of model attributes. But  the `collection.set` method will fail as it will call  `parse` on the model repeatedly.\n\nOne can deal with this error by modify the custom parse for collection to wrap each attribute in the format  model.parse expects but it is CLUMSY.\n\nIn my opinion,  the COLLECTION.FETCH should be responsible for complete valid parsing and should return a valid attributes list for each model so that  subsequent `parse` on each of the model attribute is not necessary.   This keeps the semantic clean.  However this requires a patch in the COLLECTION.FETCH   to not set the options.parse to 'true'  and call `parse` on the `response` before passing it to COLLECTION.SET.\n\nI can make the changes if desired.\n"

    "body": "I'm not sure this is actually a bug, but I found a change in behavior from v1.0.0 to v1.1.0 that I think should be noted in the changelog.\n\nWhen creating a new model (either via `new my_model()` or by calling `add()` or `create()` on a collection) with `{validate: true}`, the `invalid` event (assuming validation fails) is triggered on the new model _before_ the model's `initialize` fn is executed. For instantiating a new model, this is not a change from v1.0.0. But this does change the behavior of collection `create()` and `add()` methods, which used to validate again _after_ initializing the new model. For instance, in my code I'm attaching an event handler to the model as follows:\n\n``` js\nvar model = Backbone.Model.extend({\n    initialize: function () {\n        this.on('invalid', function (model, error) {\n            console.log(error);\n        });\n    }\n});\n```\n\nBecause the `invalid` event is triggered before this `initialize` code runs, however, doing `my_collection.add(my_invalid_data, {validate: true});` no longer triggers the `console.log(error)` code.\n\nHere is the relevant diff from v1.0.0 to v.1.1.0 (see https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/compare/1.0.0...1.1.0#diff-0d56d0d310de7ff18b3cef9c2f8f75dcL909):\n\n``` js\n       var model = new this.model(attrs, options);\n-      if (!model._validate(attrs, options)) {\n-        this.trigger('invalid', this, attrs, options);\n-        return false;\n-      }\n-      return model;\n+      if (!model.validationError) return model;\n+      this.trigger('invalid', this, model.validationError, options);\n+      return false;\n```\n\nIn v1.0.0, the `invalid` event was being triggered again by the `model._validate` fn on line 909, after the model was created on line 908. In v1.1.0, the event is only triggered once upon model creation on what is now line 913. This change causes any `invalid` event handlers attached in the model `initialize` fn to not fire. At the very least, I think this change should be noted in the public changelog.\n\nI can think of two ways to \"fix\" my code to work with v1.1.0, but I would appreciate any feedback on which is recommended:\n\n1) Attach `invalid` event handlers using the model's `constructor` fn instead of `initialize`:\n\n``` js\nvar model = Backbone.Model.extend({\n    constructor: function () {\n        this.on('invalid', function (model, error) {\n            console.log(error);\n        });\n        // call the original Backbone.Model constructor\n        Backbone.Model.apply(this, arguments);\n    }\n});\n```\n\n2) Attach `invalid` event handlers to the _collection_ instead of the model, again using the `initialize` fn:\n\n``` js\nvar collection = Backbone.Collection.extend({\n    initialize: function () {\n        this.on('invalid', function (model, error) {\n            console.log(error);\n        });\n    }\n});\n```\n\nSince models can exist without collections, it seems to me like option (1) is preferred if wanting to validate a model (with handlers listening to the `invalid` event) when it is created, though it's not ideal to have to remember to call the original Backbone.Model constructor when overriding the `constructor` fn.\n"

If I then were to call `navigate` with a URL like:\n\n```\n/resource/id/\n```\n\n`navigate` would correctly push the state and update the URL. If, however, the user reloaded the page with a URL of `/resource/id/?option=value`, then called `navigate` with this base fragment, the following conditional would be `true` and this is, in my opinion, incorrect for this case: https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js#L1478.\n"

(Actually `Collection.push` and `Collection.unshift` can already take arrays as input since they call `Collection.add`internally). Though the doc says they take a model as input.\n=> Proposal : The doc to be fixed.\n\n2) If point 1) is accepted, the returned value of `Collection.push` and `Collection.unshift` should be changed. As of today, `Collection.push` and `Collection.unshift` return the pushed/unshifted model. Should push and unshift return this collection instead of the passed model param ? That'd be coherent with `Collection.add`.\n\n3) Furthermore, in the code, i can see `_.extend({at: xxx}, options);` in the impl of `Collection.push` and `Collection.unshift`. Shouldn't it rather be `_.defaults({at: xxx}, options);`, otherwise one could do `col.push(model,{at:0})` which produces an unexpected result with regards to what you read (push), don't you think ?\n\nYour feedbacks are welcome !\n"

    "body": "I'm working on an app where we rely solely on `pushState`. For browsers who don't support it, we simply fall back to regular page loads.\n\nWhy I opened an issue, is really because the way Backbone handles routes declared in the `Router.routes` hash. As it is now, Backbone will intelligently treat hash URLs equivalent to non-hash URLs, even when `pushState` is `true`. On `Backbone.history.start()` a possible hash containing URL is replaced with a non-hash version. All well and good.\n\nBut the default behaviour of `loadUrl` is to treat the URL as a complete unit, which becomes a problem if you also want to support URLs with hashes in them. In this case a route will not match, unless you declared it as a `RegExp` in `Router.initialize`. \n\nTo tackle this, I currently override the default `loadUrl` with a version that strips the hash before calling the original `loadUrl`.\n\nPersonally, I would be interested in seeing either a new configuration setting that would enabled this behaviour in Backbone core, or finding a combination of current configuration that would have this behaviour.\n\nI would definitely be interested in contributing a PR for this, should this be deemed a worthy idea. Otherwise, I suppose I'll just keep monkey patching...\n"

    "body": "I propose to make `Backbone.Events` fire additional `before:` and `after:` events for every regular event.\n\nI came up to this idea after thinking on problem of consistency of transitions between web-app states in cases of 'inner' transitions and transitions by from 'outer world'. By inner transitions I mean changes made by using app itself (for example - by click on UI element), and by transitions from 'outer world' I mean case when user launches web-app in certain state by visiting URL.\nWhole issue is in developing technique to universally handle both 'inner' and 'outer' cases for app state.\nI write it implying that web-app is built with event-driven architecture. \n\nUse case:\nLets say we have a blogging web-app, and it have the list of blog posts and area with selected blog post content. When element from list is clicked - its highlighted and blog post content must appear. \n\n'Inner' case: user clicked on list. Here all is clear - after click, list-view triggers the event, passes info about which post is selected to the app, highlights the element corresponding to the post, and content-area view reacts to the event, and shows blog post content. Somewhere in this process current url is changes to something like `/posts/123`\n\n'Outer' case: user visits `/posts/123` by clicking on bookmark in his browser. In that case I don't want to write initialization of web-app for that particular url - `/posts/<id>`, I just want to fire `post:selected` event when this route is visited and have a function that universally serves both `inner` and `outer` cases for that event. But there is two problems appears:\n- Problem #1: How to avoid unnecessary re-renders of views? \n  If function must be universal - so it must be fully responsible for whole apps tate consistency. So it must render all views. But if user just goes from one blog post to another it will re-render blog post list, which is unnecessary. \n- Solution: Well, solution is just to check if something is already rendered and not render it again :) For example if list-view already initialized and rendered, and consistency-function sees that app already has a view of that class instantiated and rendered in certain area of document, then it not re-renders it.\n- Problem #2: How to bring views to proper state after instantiation?\n  Assume that consistency-function found that view is not instantiated and rendered - how it can make list-view highlight its element after instantiation? I can store somewhere state of an app - an information about which post is selected, and list-view can use this information, but I don't like it, I want that list view just listen for `post:selected` event and highlight a post that was passed as additional data with the event. But in this case `post:selected` is already fired and caused invocation of consistency-function, which checks for list-view existance and in this case - creates it. So I want somehow to let list-view know about `post:selected` was fired and let it highlight its element.\n- Solution:\n  This is the situation where `before:` event is useful. It makes possible to do all checks and initialization before actual event, and then release an actual event into application that was shaped to consistent state. So it will be no difference for an app before cases when `post:selected` was fired by click on UI or by visit by URL.\n\nBy `before:post:selected` consistency-function will check is all views instantiated, is document in proper state, is all needed data was requested, it will instantiate and render views if needed, and query server for data. And then app will serve regular `post:selected` event.\n"

I use MooTools in all my projects and would love to use Backbone without needing other framework dependencies, especially for my Titon project: https://github.com/titon/toolkit/tree/master/src/js\n\nI've seen this type of question asked many years ago, but looks like nothing came of it?\nhttps://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/238\nhttps://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/pull/920\n\nThis doesn't work for MooTools since the functions are different: `find`, `on`, `off`, etc. So why do we not have an actual abstraction adapter system, something like so?\n\n```\nBackbone.adapter = Backbone.Adapter.Jquery;\n// Or even just\nBackbone.$ = Backbone.Adapter.Jquery;\n```\n\nAnd then the adapter itself is simply a wrapper for basic functions. I added all the functions that seemed like they would need to be adapted, it's pretty basic.\n\n```\nBackbone.Adapter.Jquery = {\n    create: function() {\n        // create element\n    },\n    find: function(selector) {\n        return Backbone.View.$el.find(selector);\n    },\n    remove: function() {\n        return Backbone.View.$el.remove();\n    },\n    // on event\n    // off event\n    // ajax call\n};\n```\n\nRight now it seems like too much of it is hard-coded to jQuery syntax. Looking forward to your thoughts on this either way. If it seems like a good idea I could fork the project and submit a prototype.\n"

The default behavior of collection.set works great most of the time.\nI run into an issue when the user creates a new model right before the server sends an updated version of the collection to the client.\nThe problem comes from the fact that the newly created model doesn't exist in the response from the server, hence its removed from the collection.\n\nI can think of a few ways to fix this:\n1. I could pass {wait: true} into the create method, but this slows down the user-perceived \"snappyness\" of the app\n2.  I could build some kind of queue for syncing with the server\n3.  Thirdly I thought that maybe a solution could be added to Backbone core that    would let someone pass an option to collection.set that told it to keep models that    haven't been saved to the server yet?\n\nI have a commit [here](https://github.com/JoeWagner/backbone/commit/6b2e3cb6a15a3c5a17dcaa70246edb603ab9f875) that demonstrates what I'm suggesting above in \"3\"\n\nFor my use option 3 would be preferred, but I understand that maybe this doesn't belong in Backbone core, or maybe my implementation is lacking?

This is enough of a problem in fact that someone went and made a whole plug-in just to deal with it (https://github.com/STRML/backbone.routeNotFound).  Hopefully if you look at that plug-in's source you'll agree that it shouldn't need to exist.\n\nSo rather than making the 404 (or \"page not found\") route something implicit that people have to struggle to get in to the right position, could you please consider adding an explicit `Backbone.History.pageNotFound` (or something similar) method?\n\nIn other words, inside of `Backbone.History.loadUrl` instead of its current return line:\n\n```\nreturn matched;\n```\n\nif it did:\n\n```\nreturn matched || this.pageNotFound();\n```\n\nthat would be really great, and super easy.

If the only purpose is to pass along the collection's url, why not just pass it literally? (As recommended in the docs.)\n\n> If you pass a {collection: ...} as the options, the model gains a collection property that will be used to indicate which collection the model belongs to, and is used to help compute the model's url.

I have a model with lots of information and it has nested collections and models.\n\nAn example of a model with a collection, is usually the ones that fails.\n\n```\n    var MyCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({ model: VinculacionesGrafo });\n\n    var MyParentModel= Backbone.Model.extend({\n        defaults: function () {\n            return {\n                mycollec: new MyCollection,\n                finDeCarga: false\n            };\n        },\n\n        initialize: function () {\n            _.bindAll(this);\n        },\n        ....\n        loadData: function () {\n                var that = this;\n                sendRequest({\n                    type: \"post\",\n                    url: ..,\n                    dataType: \"xml\",\n                    data: { ... },\n                    success: this.success\n                });\n        },\n        success: function(data) {\n            model = new ChildModel;\n            that.get(\"mycollec\").add(model);\n        }\n```\n\nIt works allways in Firefox, Internet Explorer... But sometimes it fails in Chrome when the code is ready for production. I mean when the code is minified. At the beggining we thought it was a syncronoussly problem, but after change all collections by arrays it continues to fail in other collections that do not depends on loadding data. Allways the line with the error is something like:   that.get(\"mycollec\").add(model); And the stack is the next:\n\n```\n TypeError: Cannot read property 'operaciones' of null\n     at h.extend.get \n     at h.extend.set \n     at h.extend.add\n     at g.Model.extend.addItem \n     at f.extend.cargarNodosIniciales\n```\n\nAnd addItem method is the next (not related with the text error): \n\n```\naddItem: function (item) {\n     this.get(\"nodos\").add(item);\n},\n```\n\nAllways the error is related with some data that it is null, but the stack is not related with the error text. When the code is obfuscate and we detected it the first time, the error was something like that:\n\n```\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '1' of null \n    h.extend.get \n    h.extend.set \n    h.extend.add\n    (anonymous function)\n    t.each.t.forEach\n    g.Model.extend.loadDataMercantiles \n    g.Model.extend.loadData \n    g.Model.extend.loadDataSuccess\n    $.ajax.$.extend.success \n    m\n    p.fireWith\n    c\n    (anonymous function)\n```\n\nThe really strange thing is that when I change collections for arrays (in that code it will be mycollec: [] and push instead of add.) The bug does not appear anymore and the execution go on until it comes to another similar collection instruction.\n\nI am really afraid. It is like backbone collections are broken. They works well sometimes and in the rest of the application they never fail. But It sames that section (that load lot of data and add lot of html) breaks backbone, or maybe is there a memory leak?? \n\nI am really lost. I am so sorry because the lack of the information the first time I wrote the question.\n\nThanks a lot in advance... I really need help\n"

If not, it would call `once()` with the arguments it was passed.\n\nShould arguments passed to the event be preserved?

    "body": "Hello\n1. I found that there is no way to identify when Backbone.sync finished request in one centralized place. There is \"request\" event that applies to any request made but there is no \"response\" or \"requestEnd\" event that you can bind to know when request is finished. I know that there are \"sync\" and \"error\" events but they are maped to \"success\" and \"error\" callbacks and because of that duplication of code needs to be done to get desired effect. I think it would be much more natural to have some event mapped to \"complete\" callback. A good example would be if I wanted to show loading indicator when model starts doing request and hide it when it finishes. Now what I need to do is bind on \"request\" event to show indicator and bind to both \"error\" and \"sync\" events to hide it but I don't really care what's the status of request that came back and some sort of \"requestEnd\" would fit perfectly.\n2. When binding to \"request\" event on collection it is triggered both when collection or model starts doing request (I know it's part of events delegation mechanism). Is there any other way to distinguish which object (collection or model) initialized the request without doing \"instanceof\" check inside callback handler? Wouldn't it also feel more natural to bind events on correct objects and don't mix them up?\n\nIt's really easy to solve first issue and I would more than happy to do a pull request if it is accepted. Though the second one needs to be discussed I think.\n\nedit:\n3. Also there is only one event that identifies CRUD operations - \"sync\" but there is no way to tell apart which operation was completed. I.E. if I bind to \"sync\" event it will be fired both times when I fetch and when I save model. It would be much more better to have additional \"saved\", \"updated\" and \"fetched\" events rather than single one \"sync\".\n\nWould it be accepted as pull request to add additional events?\n"

The [reasoning provided by Jeremy](https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore/pull/431#issuecomment-3452856) has since proved mostly invalid (jQuery has confirmed that concerns regarding backwards-compatibility and wide support can be addressed by exporting the global along with AMD). It's not about arguing whether AMD is viable anymore. We've seen AMD supported across the web and win out in more and more popular javascript libraries. Probably the most notable and unfortunate exceptions today are backbone and underscore.\n\nAs [Addy said in 2011](http://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/), \"your best bets until we have both spec finalization and coverage are AMD (for in-browser modules) and CJS (for those on the server).\"\n"

It'd be a nice and handy 'data layer' in my 'tiered' node stack.\n\nHowever, any changes made to the collection are not reflected in the source data without binding to events and manually updating the data.\n\nWhile not that big of a deal, things get more complicated when I want to expose an object's nested array as a backbone collection as well.  This would have to be solved for by more event bindings or nesting the collection into the original source data itself.  Kind of hairy, and a common problem.\n### Idea\n\nIf the backbone collection and models updated the source data upon changes, it'd make life easier.  You could simply construct the appropriate collection type when it's requested on the fly--the complexity of exposing \"nested\" Backbone objects becomes substantially diminished, a complaint I've heard before in regards to backbone.\n\nHere's a scenario to try and illustrate this mess of an idea:\n\n```\nvar data = [{ id: 1, foo: 'bar' }];\nvar dataAPI = new Backbone.Collection(data, { updateSource: true });\n\n// Consumer:\ndataAPI.get(1).set('foo', 'new value');\nvar myNewModel = { bar: 'baz' };\ndataAPI.add(myNewModel);\ndataAPI.last().set('happy', true);\nmyNewModel.sad = false;\n\n// data ==> [{ id: 1, foo: 'new value' }, { bar: 'baz', happy: true, sad: false }]\n```\n\nThis is probably riddled with problems, but I'd love to discuss.\n### Caveat\n\nOne issue I already thought of: while updating the source objects will be reflected in the case of models, updating the source array will not add/remove anything from the collection.  This seems okay to me.\n"

The problem is that current `Model#set` method:\n\n```\nunset ? delete current[attr] : current[attr] = val;\n```\n\nis simply replacing the attribute value not considering possible merge when current[attr] is an instance of `Backbone.Collection`, which I feel would be desired behavior.\n\nI have slightly changed it, only to check whether this \"recursive\" merging is desired and possible:\n\n```\nunset ?\n    delete current[attr] : \n        merge && recursive && current[attr] instanceof Backbone.Collection && val instanceof Backbone.Collection ?\n            current[attr].add(val.models, { merge: true }) : current[attr] = val;\n```\n\nwhere `merge` and `recursive` are passed as `Model#set` options:\n\n```\nmerge           = options.merge;\nrecursive       = options.recursive;\n```\n\nThe reason I've included additional `recursive` option to `Model#set` is because I didn't want to break existing functionality which replaces nested collection instead of merging it.\n\nSimilar request was reported already (#2316) but in my opinion the proposed solution wasn't generic enough to be merged with Backbone itself.\n\nI have already created a patch and wrote the tests and it looks like it's working really well.

I feel like this is a fairly consistent (and advocated) pattern for dealing with nested models/collections... and another case where the temporary model creation causes issues.\n\nMy preferred solution would be to say that anything coming into the parse should already be in a general model format (not allowing `[{model: {id:1...}, model: {id: 2...}}]`, only `[{id:1}..., {id: 2...}]`) and going back to being able to assume that the model can be identity checked based on `idAttribute`, and if you need otherwise - doing it on `Backbone.ajax`:\n\n``` js\nBackbone.ajax = function(options) {\n  if (options.badApi) {\n    if (options.type === 'GET') {\n      var success = options.success;\n      options.success = function(resp) {\n        return success(_.pluck(resp, 'model'));\n      };\n    }\n  }\n  return Backbone.$.ajax.apply(Backbone.$, options);\n};\n```\n\n@caseywebdev - off the top of your head, do you know roughly what revision I should look at to get the `set` I'd need to get this case working in the short term... was it done this way on 0.9.9?\n"

Step 2 is the fiddly one as it means multiple code changes.\n\nassuming it is \"good practice\" to always include this token, should backbone encourage (and possibly facilitate) setting the headers?\n\nthe solution for me was to include this in all my backbone calls that wrap jquery.ajax:\n\n```\nbeforeSend: function (request) {                         \n  request.setRequestHeader(\"X-CSRF-Token\", xcrsftoken);  \n},                                                       \n```\n\nit would be lovely if I could simply do something like this on start-up then think no more about it, and leave it to backbone to include the header in all ajax calls:\n\n```\nbackbone.csrfToken = xcrsftoken;\n```\n"

Causing in my app the entire layout to be re-rendered each time and the search looses focus on each keystroke.\n\nWhy it was decided to encode only in Firefox, and decode in every other browser I cannot understand?\n\nThe same code execution across browsers can be achieved by adding back `decodeURIComponent` to `match[1]` in this odd function (it was removed).\n\n``` javascript\n// Gets the true hash value. Cannot use location.hash directly due to bug\n// in Firefox where location.hash will always be decoded.\ngetHash: function(window) {\n  var match = (window || this).location.href.match(/#(.*)$/);\n  return match ? match[1] : '';\n},\n```\n\nAlso the comment explains the exact opposite of the issue on firefox - in firefox the space character IS encoded and thus needs to be decoded to create consistency with other browsers.\n\nIs someone able to explain why this was done?\n\nThanks\n"

I passed the name of the view I'm editing to `model.set`,\nand verify it at the `render` method to see if that's produce by it self.\nFake code like:\n\n``` coffee\n\nclass ViewA\n  events:\n    \"blur .data\": \"update\"\n\n  render: (model, value, options) ->\n    if (not options?) or (options.triggerBy isnt 'A')\n      @$('.data').val @.model.get('data')\n\n  update: (event) ->\n    data = \"something got from a contenteditable of view\"\n    @model.set \"title\", data, triggerBy: 'A'\n\nclass ViewB\n  events:\n    \"blur .data\": \"update\"\n\n  render: (model, value, options) ->\n    if (not options?) or (options.triggerBy isnt 'B')\n      @$('.data').val @.model.get('data')\n\n  update: (event) ->\n    data = \"something got from a contenteditable of view\"\n    @model.set \"title\", data, triggerBy: 'B'\n```\n\nAnd comes another problem, there are events triggered without a `triggerBy` attribute.\nFor example, events triggered by Ajax, and will not be recognized.\nAnd I even have no idea about adding `silent: yes` to mute that event.\nSo this is not an available solution either.\n\nTo such a case, what's the solution in a Backbone way?\n"

Url replaced to http://something.com/list/items/5#, and then **index** action executed. \nThen url converts to http://something.com/#list/items/5 and **items** action executed.\n\nAfter investigation I found that **checkUrl** method of History called before url conversion from pushState-enabled format to hash based. Look at History.start method. First if oldIE insert iframe and navigate to current fragment.\n\n```\n if (oldIE && this._wantsHashChange) {\n    this.iframe = Backbone.$('<iframe src=\"javascript:0\" tabindex=\"-1\" />').hide().appendTo('body')[0].contentWindow;\n    this.navigate(fragment);\n  }\n```\n\nWhich causes url transform to http://something.com/list/items/5#. Then because oldIE and need hash change we starting **checkUrl** timer with 50ms interval.\n\n```\n  // Depending on whether we're using pushState or hashes, and whether\n  // 'onhashchange' is supported, determine how we check the URL state.\n  if (this._hasPushState) {\n    Backbone.$(window).on('popstate', this.checkUrl);\n  } else if (this._wantsHashChange && ('onhashchange' in window) && !oldIE) {\n    Backbone.$(window).on('hashchange', this.checkUrl);\n  } else if (this._wantsHashChange) {\n    this._checkUrlInterval = setInterval(this.checkUrl, this.interval);\n  }\n```\n\nAnd only after that converting of 'pushState'-enabled format to hash based. \n\n```\n  // Determine if we need to change the base url, for a pushState link\n  // opened by a non-pushState browser.\n  this.fragment = fragment;\n  var loc = this.location;\n  var atRoot = loc.pathname.replace(/[^\\/]$/, '$&/') === this.root;\n\n  // If we've started off with a route from a `pushState`-enabled browser,\n  // but we're currently in a browser that doesn't support it...\n  if (this._wantsHashChange && this._wantsPushState && !this._hasPushState && !atRoot) {\n    this.fragment = this.getFragment(null, true);\n    this.location.replace(this.root + this.location.search + '#' + this.fragment);\n    // Return immediately as browser will do redirect to new url\n    return true;\n\n  // Or if we've started out with a hash-based route, but we're currently\n  // in a browser where it could be `pushState`-based instead...\n  }\n```\n\nSo **checkUrl** sometimes executed before url convertion. May be possible fix is convert url to hash based format before starting **checkUrl** timer.\n"

However the value of **this.fragment**  to which it is compared is got from whatever is passed to **Backbone.router.navigate()**.  If we encode the hash that is passed to this function with **encodeURIComponent()** (or even **encodeURI()**), even Firefox will not encode the single quote to **%27**.

    "body": "I have a very big performance problem. I have a big table created with thousands views. I have a cell view because it has complex behaviour and I need that this object be a view. Each of this cell have some listenTo  to listen the events. \nSo I have a very big array _event with all events more or less 42.000 events and some of them have 42.000 callbacks. As I know that some events are only listened by the cells I off it directly by the model because is easier and quicker. \n`model.off(\"change:view\")`\nBut when a view do a stopListening(), the method off try to find the event that has this view, but this event don't exist because it was deleted by the before off. The performance problem is that the method off have to loop through 42.000 events and in some events through 42.000 context to find itself and delete it. Then we have a 42.000^42.000 loop to find nothing because this event is already deleted.\n\nShould have a way to loop the events by event, other to loop by callback and other to loop by context to do this loops efficiently. Because in this case it only loop by context and as the context don't exist the off do nothing and finish. \n\nOther problem with off is that the callback or context aren't being deleted unless this event only have one context or one callback. See the off code:\n\n``` javascript\nif (callback || context) {\n    for (j = 0, k = events.length; j < k; j++) {\n         ev = events[j];\n         if ((callback && callback !== ev.callback && callback !== ev.callback._callback) ||\n                  (context && context !== ev.context)) {\n                retain.push(ev);\n         }\n    }\n}\nif (!retain.length) delete this._events[name];\n```\n\nThis loop search if an event have a callback or a context different than me, and if this don't happen then it delete the event. BUT if there are a context or callback then don't delete anything, when as I think, it must delete the context or the callback if it find it, and delete the event if the event is empty after. \n\nI want to do a fork to improve all this things, but before I would like to know your opinion. What do you think about this issue?\n"

For time and transportation efficiency it is preferable if the speaker lives in The Netherlands or in a country close by, but if there is a serious speaker who lives far from The Netherlands I can bring this up with the company and see what we can do about that\n\nBesides in the interest in technologies and technical ideas, the event is a good opportunity for socialization and meeting smart people and make more connections which will help to spread the word more about Backbone. There will be drinks and food served and the attendees will have lots of fun\n\nHope to have one (or more) of you to come and show us the great features of Backbone\n\nLooking forward to your reply\n\n[1] http://www.onehippo.com/en/\n[2] http://www.meetup.com/Hippo-Meetup/\n"

This, to me, seems a bit clunky, as I had assumed that `#set` will automatically do this merge for me since there's a `merge` option. I understand that sometimes order can't be guaranteed in a response, but I'd rather do a single `#set` (maybe even passing in an explicit options to not remove/add models) rather than manually loop through the response's attributes and update each model individually.

Any sufficiently complex application (see: real world applications) has a need for managing views within views, and cleaning up after them properly. The (well received) addition of `listenTo` helps with this to a degree, but I think Backbone could do a bit more.\n\nThis is something I add to pretty much whatever I'm working with, and it does the job without much overhead or complexity:\n\n``` js\nvar View = Backbone.View;\nBackbone.View = Backbone.View.extend({\n\n  constructor: function() {\n    this.subviews = [];\n    View.apply(this, arguments);\n  },\n\n  addSubview: function(view) {\n    if (!(view instanceof Backbone.View)) {\n      throw new Error(\"Subviews must be a Backbone.View\");  \n    }\n    this.subviews.push(view);\n    return view;\n  },\n\n  removeSubviews: function() {\n    var children = this.subviews;\n    for (var i = 0, l = children.length; i<l; i++) {\n      children[i].remove();\n    }\n    this.subviews = [];\n    return this;\n  },\n\n  remove: function() {\n    this.removeSubviews();\n    View.prototype.remove.apply(this, arguments);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nI completely understand and agree with Backbone's position to keep things simple and not implement applications specific components; at the same time I think providing a very, very basic starting point for this problem would be a great help to many.\n\nThis starting point could then be extended upon with more opinionated libraries or frameworks like layoutmanager, thorax, marionette, etc.\n\n/cc @tbranyen\n"

    "body": "Currently when you pass an attribute hash to `Collection.set`, and a model with the same id already exists in the collection resulting in a merge, the Model's default values are applied before the merge takes place.\n\nThis means that if you give `.set` a selection of attributes that you want to be merged into the model, any attributes that you don't give it, that have defaults defined, will override existing non-default values.\n\nTo me this seems very unexpected. `Collection.set` seems like the perfect way to apply partial updates to models, but with the current functionality this isn't possible.\n\nExample:\n\n``` javascript\nvar Model = Backbone.Model.extend({\n  defaults: {\n    key: 'value'\n  }\n});\nvar m = new Model({id: 1, key: 'nondefault'});\nvar col = new Backbone.Collection([m], {model: Model});\n\ncol.set({id: 1, otherkey: 'other'}, {merge: true});\n\nconsole.log(col.first().attributes);\n// result:   {id: 1, key: \"value\", otherkey: \"other\"}\n// expected: {id: 1, key: \"nondefault\", otherkey: \"other\"}\n```\n\nThe confusing thing is that setting the attributes on the model directly behaves differently (the way I would have expected `Collection.set` to behave):\n\n``` javascript\nvar Model = Backbone.Model.extend({\n  defaults: {\n    key: 'value'\n  }\n});\nvar m = new Model({id: 1, key: 'nondefault'});\nm.set({id: 1, otherkey: 'other'})\nconsole.log(m.attributes);\n// result: {id: 1, key: \"nondefault\", otherkey: \"other\"}\n```\n\n**Edit:**\n\nActually, testing with 0.9.10, this seems to be a regression:\n\n``` javascript\n// Version 0.9.10\n\nvar Model = Backbone.Model.extend({\n  defaults: {\n    key: 'value'\n  }\n});\nvar m = new Model({id: 1, key: 'nondefault'});\nvar col = new Backbone.Collection([m], {model: Model});\n\ncol.update({id: 1, otherkey: 'other'}, {merge: true});\n\nconsole.log(col.first().attributes);\n// result: {id: 1, key: \"nondefault\", otherkey: \"other\"}\n```\n\n**Edit:**\n\nThis commit seems to be the source of the change: https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/commit/a920fed91b0108e3f722ad002e228c6046c1e3b6\n\nWas it really intended?\n"

Now I realized that Backbone\u2019s version doesn\u2019t maintain the order when updating:\n\n```\ncollection = new Backbone.Collection([{id:0}, {id:2}, {id:4}]);\ncollection.set([{id:0}, {id:1}, {id:2}, {id:3}, {id:4}])\ncollection.pluck('id')\nActual: [0, 2, 4, 1, 3]\nExpected: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n```\n\nThat is, the new models aren\u2019t inserted at the right position. Is this behavior on purpose?\n\nCollection#set is generally more useful than Collection#reset. It doesn\u2019t throw away all models and creates them from scratch. With `add`, `remove` and `change` events, it\u2019s easier to build list views that is optimized for performance. We have been using it for Chaplin\u2019s optimized [CollectionView](https://github.com/chaplinjs/chaplin/blob/master/src/chaplin/views/collection_view.coffee).\n\nIf I fetch a list as a JSON array from the server, I expect the collection to reflect the input order. If the server returns `[{\"id\":0}, {\"id\":1}, {\"id\":2}, {\"id\":3}, {\"id\":4}]`, the collection order should be the same. I know that I can `.fetch({ reset: true })` to maintain the order, but then I\u2019m losing all the benefits of Collection#set\u2019s smart updating.\n"

Fix the breaking tests and keep it in the docs (that would need to be included in a minor release and noted in the changelog.) There are currently 4 failing tests: 3 have to do with `delegateEvents` and 1 can be fixed directly in the test suite (it's relying on a `:has` pseudo-selector, which Zepto chokes on.)\n2. Open an issue with Zepto and ask them to imitate jQuery more faithfully, but I doubt that Fuchs would bite on that.\n3. The nuclear option: remove official support from the docs.\n\nSo far, there are 3 projects in the examples section that use it: LinkedIn Mobile, Gilt Groupe, and Tzigla. Based on the relatively high profile of the first 2 names on that list, and the fact that it's still called out as a valid option in the docs, I think that _something_ needs to be done.\n\n(FWIW, I totally agree with the decision to drop support for it, I just don't want it to trip people up when it doesn't actually work.)\n"

Previously we overrode fetch and before invoking the original method, set the `options.url` property to be `collection.url(options)`.  The models in the collection don't use or want this info in their URL - they instead rely on an implementation of urlRoot to get their base url.\n\nIn 1.0, that url we passed to collection.fetch gets passed to the model constructor in the options hash and copied in as a property - so the default `url` function on the Model gets overridden, the `urlRoot` function never gets called, and `sync` calls end up talking to the wrong endpoint.\n\nTo workaround, we quit passing in a url in the options hash to fetch and instead modified Backbone.sync to pass options as an argument to the url function (this felt appropriate given that the options were already being passed to the model's `toJSON`):\n\nOriginal\n\n```\nif (!options.url) {\n  params.url = _.result(model, 'url') || urlError();\n}\n```\n\nNew:\n\n```\nif (!options.url) {\n  params.url = ( _.isFunction(model.url) ? model.url.call(model, options) : model.url ) || urlError();\n}\n```\n\nAny ideas on a better way to handle this, and if not, would a pull request be welcome?\n"

We're going to keep hunting for that specific type of feature, and if you think that you've found one, please send it on in. In an ecosystem where overarching, decides-everything-for-you frameworks are commonplace, and many libraries require your site to be restructured to suit their look, feel, and default behavior \u2014 Backbone should continue to be a tool that gives you the freedom to design the full experience of your web application.\n\nI found this to be a very clear explanation of the goals of the Backbone.js project, one that isn't mentioned anywhere in the documentation.  Currently the documentation explains what Backbone.js _is_, but not what it wants to _be_.\n\nI think adding this paragraph (or one similar) would help guide and focus the development of Backbone.js for all current and new contributors. \n\nOn the other hand...it may be un-necessary and superfluous to what is currently there, but I'd argue on the contrary. :)\n"

This makes wrapping start with a spy difficult to cleanly do a in a test\n2.  Backbone.history.start() throws an error if you call it more than once.  This is difficult if you have a situation where you want to start history management once a model (or series of models) have been loaded.  If you have tests for those models, they may trigger the event that causes history.start() to be called.\n\nThere are a couple of potential solutions:\n1.  If Backbone.history were always present, you could use a spy on start() and prevent the actual method from firing\n2.  There could be a history.stop() method that corresponds to history.start() that would allow you use an afterEach() for every test that may call history.start() that would put history management back in a state that allows for start() to be called again.\n\nIf you guys agree that these are issues that should be addressed and agree that these solutions (or others) make sense, I would be happy to make the changes and submit a pull request\n"

In my opinion, that was a very nice feature that is now gone and it would be awesome if it came back (though I realize you guys have some opinions as to why you don't want people to use silent sets, and I'm not going to argue with you on that).  However, the docs clearly state the following:\n\nhttp://backbonejs.org/#Model-set\n\n> If any of the attributes change the model's state, a \"change\" event will be triggered, unless {silent: true} is passed as an option.\n\nhttp://backbonejs.org/#Model-changed\n\n> The changed property is the internal hash containing all the attributes that have changed **since the last \"change\" event was triggered**. Please do not update changed directly since its state is internally maintained by set. A copy of changed can be acquired from changedAttributes.\n\nPer the docs, the 'changed' attributes should not be reset until a change event is triggered.  I would expect the following, then:\n\n``` javascript\nvar model = new Backbone.Model();\nmodel.set('foo', 'bar', {silent : true});\nmodel.set('bar', 'baz', {silent : true});\nmodel.set('baz', 'bing', {silent : true});\n\n/**\n * The result of this call should be\n * {\n *    foo: 'bar',\n *    bar: 'baz',\n *    baz: 'bing'\n * }\n */\nmodel.changedAttributes();\n```\n\nInstead, the result is just `{baz : 'bing'}`.

Simple example would be `setDomLibrary` is simply removed instead of deprecating it on a minor version change.  If you guys aren't using \"semver\" could you maybe elaborate on what your versioning numbers  mean or maybe why you dislike semver.\n\nThe other question is that I am using socket.io to override `Backbone.sync`, here is my method:\n\n``` js\nBackbone.sync = function(method, model, options) {\n    var event = model.route + ':' + method;\n    io.emit(event, model.toJSON(), function(data) {\n        options.success(data);\n    });\n});\n```\n\nIt seems like the signature for `options.success` has changed dramatically, and a few quick fixes did not really help.

Milestones have seldom been used in the project before, but I think that they could be helpful for determining any new features or issues that are related to the eventual plans to cut a 1.0 release (or 0.10, whatever folks can agree on.)\n\nI know some areas of the library still have room to improve, but getting consistent releases out is extremely important when it comes to tracking and addressing bugs and features. The amount of time between 0.9.2 and 0.9.9 led to some headaches and oversights documenting everything that changed in those 9 commit-filled months.\n\nSo, let's create a milestone for the next release and figure out where the finish line is, so-to-speak.\n"

I also noticed that the current Collection.model documentation implies that you need to specify this property in order to have the collection create new models (which isn't true; if you don't specify it, plain Backbone.Models will get created).\n\nTherefore, I propose the following alternative documentation:\n\nOverride this property to specify the model class that the collection contains. You can pass raw attributes objects (and arrays) to add, create, and reset, and the attributes will be converted into a Backbone model.  If this property is set, the newly created models will be of the specified type.\n\nThis property can also be set to a factory function, which can then be used to generate different classes of models as appropriate.  This function will be passed the same parameters as the Model constructor, and should return a Model.\n"

That's great, unless you want to do something with that model that got added.  In that case, you can't just use the return value of `add`, because 'add' just returns `this`  (as an aside, who chains off a `collection.add` call anyway?) .  Instead, you have to:\n\nA) set-up an \"add\" event handler on the collection, wait for it to get triggered, then do whatever it was you wanted to do with the added object (from a totally different place in the code than where the model got added).  And if you added multiple objects, you'll of course have multiple events to deal with\n\nB) use the `_.last` built-in to Collection to get your model back ... with the assumption being that you only added one model, and that it got added to the end of the collection\n\nBoth those solutions are potentially problematic, so I was wondering: why not add a `addAndReturn` or `addValue` or some similar method which works identically to add, only instead of returning this it would return the `add` variable inside the function.\n\nAlternatively, if you could just break backward compatibility and make `add` work as I just described, I really think that would be the best solution (but I understand that there might be _someone_ out there chaining off of `collection.add`).\n"

This pattern has worked great for me so far.\n\nHowever, let's now say that I need to do something like this:\n\n``` javascript\nnew Parent({ child: { name: 'Kim' } }, { parse: true });\n```\n\nThis results in:\n\n![parse](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5259/216856/46fce87a-84d7-11e2-832a-36b147e306d2.png)\n\nThe problem is that [`parse` is called before `initialize`](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/blob/000f4bcd97f012da513116030cf994e17202eb67/backbone.js#L248).\n\nIs this intended? Too me it seems strange that attributes are set on the model before initialize is called. I would expect the constructor to be called first, before anything else happens.\n\nHow would you solve the example above?\n\nSome of the things I've thought about:\n- Create the child in `parse`. However, sometimes I need to bind events to it before data is fetched (or rather, I don't want the app to need to think about whether data is fetched or not)\n- Never use `{ parse: true }` in `initialize`. But then, how would I solve the parsing when I need to create the model?\n- Create a helper function, e.g. `ensureChildExists()` which creates and sets `this.child` if it does not exist already. Ugly solution.\n"

Is the next:\n\nFor example, we have two Backbone Views: A parent view (PersonView) and its subview (LocationView). Their templates, in Mustache notation, are the next (see the image):\n\n![templates code](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3717778/214397/4186991a-841c-11e2-8646-455cb7d13376.jpg)\n\nNOTE that these templates does NOT have a parent element; so, Backbone will asignate them the \"div\" element by default in the \"el\" property.\n\nIn PersonView's \"render\" method, How can we add the LocationView's rendered HTML into \"PersonView.el\" WITHOUT loossing LocationView's events and WITHOUT ADDING the deafult wrapping \"div\" element of \"LocationView.el\"?\n\nWe have tried many ways, and if we remove de subview's \"el\" property, we always loose the events (in the subviews), but if we keep that \"el\", then we have problems if we want to associate it with jQuery events :-(\n\nAnybody has any solution about this?

    "body": "The attribute assignment in `Model#set` is now just this simple:\n\n``` javascript\nunset ? delete current[attr] : current[attr] = val;\n```\n\nThere are cases when it would be convenient to override the assignment.\nFor example, when `Model#set` is called from `Collection#update` (merge), and the object structure is like this (it would be in CoffeeScript to be brief):\n\n``` coffeescript\n\nclass A extends Model\n    // attributes: attr1, attr2\n\ncollA = new Collection([{ id: \"a1\", attr1: 1 }], {model: A})\n\nclass B extends Model\n    // attribute: collA\n\ncollB =  new Collection([{ id: \"b1\", collA: collA }], {model: B})\n```\n\nSuppose, we have some new data for `collB` (some attributes of `A` instance in `collA` collection had been changed somewhere):\n\n``` javascript\nstate = [{ \n   id: \"b1\",\n   collA: [ { id: \"a1\", attr2: 2 }]\n}]\n```\n\nWe want to _update_ the state of `A` instances in `collA`\n\n``` coffeescript\ncollB.update(state, {add: false, remove: false})\n```\n\nThis will _overwrite_ `collA` attribute in `B` instance. The intention was to _update_ the collection instead. It would be possible if the assignment in `Model#set` is abstracted, something like:\n\n``` javascript\nunset ? delete current[attr] : this.update(attr, val, options);\n.....\n\nupdate: function (attr, val, options) {\n     this.attributes[attr] = val;\n}\n```\n\nSo it would be possible to override it in `B`:\n\n``` coffeescript\nclass B extends Model\n    update: (attr, val, options) ->\n        if attr == \"collA\"\n            collA = @get \"collA\"\n            if collA\n                collA.update(val, options)\n                return\n        super\n```\n\nWhat do you think? \n"

    "body": "If your model contains some complex data in some of its fields (say some nested simple objects) then the object returned by `toJSON` will refer to these by reference. So if you mess around with the values in your `toJSON` object then you are inadvertently silently poisoning your model data directly.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n``` javascript\n// Init model with data object\nvar model = new Backbone.Model({\n    simpleValue: \"foo\",\n    objectValue: {\n        subObject: {\n            nestedValue: \"bar\"\n        }\n    }\n});\n\n// Create a toJSON representation\nvar modelJSON = model.toJSON();\n\n// Change some values in your toJSON object\nmodelJSON.simpleValue = \"baz\";\nmodelJSON.objectValue.subObject.nestedValue = \"baz\";\n\nconsole.log(model.get(\"simpleValue\")); // returns \"foo\", as expected\nconsole.log(model.get(\"objectValue\").subObject.nestedValue); // returns \"baz\", lolwut?\n```\n\nSo it seems like `toJSON` is returning references to complex objects in the model, not clones. Is that desired behaviour? It just took me ages to track down this issue. I was doing some post-processing and calculations on some to `toJSON` results before sending back to the server expecting it to be free of repercussions ...\n"

Backbone simply proxies through model events though so if you add 50 models to a collection, the add event is called 50 times and thus the whole view is rendered 50 times. This is unexpected behaviour since the collection method only takes arrays of models:\n\n``` javascript\ncollection.add([model1, model2, model3])\n```\n\nrather than passing them in individual:\n\n``` javascript\ncollection.add(model1);\ncollection.add(model1);\ncollection.add(model2);\n```\n\nI expect the same to be reflected in the event callback since I'm not listening to the model but the collection as a whole. \n\nIs there currently a clean way of adapting a collection to support this behaviour or is this something that could be added into the core? I know this is expected behaviour at the moment so I'm not raising it as a bug but I'm not sure how useful it currently is. \n"

    "body": "Hi,\n\nI have a collection that listens to changes in a model to then update itself, like this:\n\n```\nthis.listenTo(this.user, \"change:addresses\", this.fetch);\n```\n\nAnd it was getting back the user's own data, instead of the expected. After some probing I figured that `change` events pass `(model, value, options)` to the callbacks, which in this case meant `sync` was eventually getting the user model as it's `option` param.\n\nThe user model has its own url, and 8478567 means it is then overriding the collection's url for the request.\n\nI understand this is an edge case, and can be easily circumvented by using `function(){ this.fetch(); }` instead, but maybe it deserves some looking into. Specially since I believe this also means `fetch` can't be bound to any event.\n\nRight now I can't think of a good way to solve it that won't break 8478567, though. Maybe needing to explicitly state you want to override the request settings in `sync`?\n"

This is useful for polymorphic collections.\n\n``` coffeescript\nclass FTB.Collections.Resources extends FTB.Collection\n    model: (attributes, options) ->\n        new FTB.Models[attributes.type](attributes, options)\n```\n\nHere is my example, I have 4 different kinds of model that are populated inside my polymorphic collection, but their \"id\" attribute could repeat since it is only unique for each table.. so one of my solutions was to change the \"idAttribute\" to something like \"uuid\" and solve my problem.\n\n``` coffeescript\nclass FTB.Models.Document extends FTB.Model\n    urlRoot: \"/documents\"\n    idAttribute: \"uuid\"\n\n    url: ->\n        if @get('id') then \"#{@urlRoot}/#{@get('id')}\" else @urlRoot\n```\n\nBut now all my model URLs will use the \"uuid\" attribute for fetch, save and other stuffs.. something that was not what I wanted.. my workaround was to overrite the \"url\" method for accomplish that, but it seems that backbone.js could handle my problem really well with a configuration inside collection similar to the \"idAttribute\" inside models.\n"

If it's something you'd like to add, I'd be happy to create the tests for it, but this link is broken right now: http://backbonejs.org/test/test.html\n\nAnyway, I modified some code to allow the options hash to contain an override for setting the X-HTTP-Method-Override. If that gets set to 'false', then it doesn't do it at all. Otherwise, if it's not present, or is 'true', it still does it. If it's set to a function, it calls the function.\n\n``` javascript\n    // For older servers, emulate HTTP by mimicking the HTTP method with `_method`\n    // And an `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header.\n    if (options.emulateHTTP && (type === 'PUT' || type === 'DELETE' || type === 'PATCH')) {\n      params.type = 'POST';\n      if (options.emulateJSON) params.data._method = type;\n      function setRequestHeader(xhr, header, value) {\n        xhr.setRequestHeader(header, value);\n      }      \n      var beforeSend = options.beforeSend;\n      options.beforeSend = function(xhr) {\n        if (_.isFunction(options.setXHttpMethodOverride)) {\n          setRequestHeader = options.setXHttpMethodOverride;\n        }\n        if (options.setXHttpMethodOverride !== false) {\n          setRequestHeader(xhr, 'X-HTTP-Method-Override', type);\n        }\n        if (beforeSend) return beforeSend.apply(this, arguments);\n      };\n    }\n```\n\nI needed this because my web server requires setting special support even for sending the header, access control settings. So, because our API uses POST, this just made it easier to avoid that additional web-server configuration step.\n\nI have a working example here:\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/v7cBn/4/\n\nLine 50 is where you can play around with the setXHttpMethodOverride parameter.\n\nAnyway, if you'd like me to add a pull request for it, I'll be happy to write tests for it, if that link starts working again, or if you point me to a working link.\n\nThank you,\nJosh\n"

Turns out IE8 does not recognize \"PATCH\" as a valid HTTP method, below is a list of supported methods:\n\nThe object permits only the following HTTP methods: \"GET\", \"POST\", \"HEAD\", \"PUT\", \"DELETE\", \"MOVE\", \"PROPFIND\", \"PROPPATCH\", \"MKCOL\", \"COPY\", \"LOCK\", \"UNLOCK\", \"OPTIONS\".\n\nIs there a possible workaround to this?\n\nEDIT: After doing a little more research, turns out this is certainly on jQuery's end.  The ActiveXObject for XMLHTTP requests does support PATCH, but the native XMLHttpRequest in IE8 does not.  jQuery ends up using the native version, since it's available to the browser.  This is all in IE9, but using IE8 compatibility mode, I wonder if this issue would persist if the user was using native IE8.  I'll try to test a little more and respond, but for now I'll try to submit a bug report to the jQuery team, since the problem is on their end.\n"

    "body": "Currently in the docs and in the community, it seems `toJSON` has two uses:\n1. Turn a model's attributes into an object to be stringified before being sent to the server in `sync`. Overriding `toJSON` on a model gives the user the ability to construct a custom representation of a resource to be sent to the server. There is no other way to do this, accept for overriding sync?\n2. To clone a model's attributes into a plain object to be used in template rendering.\n\nOnce a model has overridden `toJSON` to get the functionality described in the first use case, the second use case is broken.  For example, let's say that I have a `TodoItem` model, and my server expects there be a root `todo` property in the JSON representation of this model, I could override `toJSON` like so:\n\n```\nvar TodoItem = Backbone.Model.extend({\n  toJSON: function(){\n    return { \"todo\": _.clone(this.attributes) };\n  }\n});\n```\n\nNow in my View, it no longer makes sense to use `toJSON` when rendering a template, so instead I search the documentation and see that the documentation for [render](http://backbonejs.org/#View-render) uses `toJSON`, so then, starting to feel a little crazy, I head back over to the [toJSON](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-toJSON) docs and find this:\n\n```\nReturn a copy of the model's attributes for JSON stringification. This can be used for persistence, serialization, or for augmentation before being handed off to a view\n```\n\nI think it makes sense to use `toJSON` for stringification (since that's what is in the JSON.stringify spec) but it makes less sense to overload the it with \"augmentation before being handed off to a view\".\n\nMy suggestion would be either to alter the docs to clarify a single purpose for `toJSON`, or maybe even introduce a new function for the \"augmentation before being handed off to a view\" functionality.\n"

I might go so far as to suggest [JSDuck](https://github.com/senchalabs/jsduck) documentation to generate it, with return signatures and the like.\n\nIn any case, I was thinking something like the following:\n\n---\n## fetch collection.fetch([options])\n\nFetch the default set of models for this collection from the server, resetting the collection when they arrive. Delegates to Backbone.sync under the covers for custom persistence strategies and returns a jqXHR. The server handler for fetch requests should return a JSON array of models.\n\n``` javascript\n// code sample\n```\n### Options\n- `success`: Callback for a successful request, passed `(collection, response, options)`\n- `error`: Callback for a failed request, passed `(collection, xhr, options)`\n- `update`: If `true`, will use `update` to (intelligently) merge the fetched models when the model data returns from the server.  If `false`, the collection will be (efficiently) reset.\n\n---\n\nJust wanted to gauge interest - happy to do the legwork.\n"

(like the original dispose implementation of #1461), to take care of cases like this automatically?

I think the writer of this test thinks the two 'change' events that are recorded were fired by the first two non silent sets, when it is actually `model.set({z: true}, {silent:true});` that triggers the second  'change' (before the last set fires). You'll have to step through this last test to see what happens.\n\nMy understanding of current functionality is that each `set`, regardless of whether or not the set happens inside some kind of change event should fire one `change` event, and that silent sets never fire their own `change` event. So if you have a bunch of silent sets, then a non silent set, there will still only be one change event.\n\nNote that this was the state of affairs before pull request #2022. I'm not sure what's wrong here, or if something is wrong, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention. \n"

    "body": "So I have a problem with Backbone 0.9.9 in my existing application not firing certain events that previously got fired:\n\n``` javascript\nvar\n  model = new Backbone.Model({ selected: false }),\n  calls = 0;\n\nmodel.on('change:selected', function () {\n  calls++;\n});\n\nmodel.set('selected', true, {silent: true});\nmodel.set('selected', false);\n// calls is 0 in Backbone 0.9.9\n// calls is 1 in Backbone 0.9.2\n```\n\nModel._computeChanges in 0.9.9 is responsible for this behavior and it's obviously a performance optimization for not firing events that don't need to be fired. But I wonder if this is really the right behavior.\n\nImagine a Backbone view with subviews and many models with a selected state. Now the user can select multiple items by clicking on each of the items to select multiple single items. No problem here. But now I have a functionality \"select all / deselect all items\" which sets the selected value of each model silently, so it won't trigger a rerender for each subview in the loop, which would make sense because the Backbone documentation itself states this as a way to do it:\n\n> Passing {silent: true} as an option will defer both the validation and the event. This is useful when you want to change attributes provisionally or rapidly, without propagating the change through the rest of the system. That said, silent doesn't mean that the change (and event) won't happen, it's merely silenced until the next change.\n\n\"until the next change\" is what's different from 0.9.2 to 0.9.9. Previously a \"change\" was just a change of the model value (what's correct IMHO). Now in 0.9.9 a \"change\" is a change of the model value **from its previous non-silent change**. That's a huge difference and will affect code that expected the previous behavior.\n\nIn my \"select all / deselect all\" example my problem is that the user can't change single items anymore after doing \"select all / deselect all\" because the bulk changes got executed silently and after that I execute a custom event to rerender my whole view instead of each subview for performance reasons -  now if the user tries to change an single item the change will be made in the model but the events won't get fired anymore and the subview won't get rerendered.\n"

At it stands now, the removal of it breaks a number of existing code on my end. Returning `options.index` itself only adds a constant time, the problem is with `splice`, which #1667 fails to address. `options.index` should be added back so the API is preserved. </del>\n1. `sort()` is called automatically all over the place, which immediately adds an O(n log n) running time on a number of operations. Sparse arrays and `splice` aren't exactly performant either... If performance is a concern, and breaking the API is OK, then why not...\n2. Remove `comparator` and automatically calling `sort()` on all the methods in the next **major** version <del> and put `options.index` back in for 0.9.9? It only adds a constant time to `add`.</del> I don't think it's unreasonable to expect users to call `sort(comparator)` themselves in a future version after each addition and removal. It's implied that any element insertion and removal might break an ordering unless you happen to do it at the right place, which the user should know about.\n\nThoughts? @jashkenas @caseywebdev @braddunbar @philfreo\n"

My immediate thought is to do something like set a flag on a collection which is set to true on a successful fetch. Something like:\n\n```\nthis.on('sync', function () { _synced = true; }, this);\n```\n\nand then:\n\n```\nCollection.prototype.isNew = function () {\n    return !!_synced;\n}\n```\n\nBut I'm sure others may have a better way.\n"

I did not find one in my searching.\n\nWhat is the reasoning behind not including an \"elements\" (Spine), or \"ui\" (Backbone Marionette) hash in backbone proper, that fetches and saves references to elements within this.$el based on selectors? For example, the way it works in Marionette is:\n\n```\nMyView = Backbone.View.extend( {\n    events : {\n        \"keydown [name='value']\" : \"_valueFld_onKeyDown\"\n    }\n\n    ui {\n        \"valueFld\" : \"[name='value']\"\n    }\n\n    ...\n} )\n```\n\nNow after the view is rendered you can find this.$el( \"[name='value']\" ) in this.ui.valueFld. See the [Marionette docs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.itemview.md#organizing-ui-elements) for a discussion.\n\nI would make some small changes to this implementation but it seems that the basic concept would be very useful to close to 100% of people using backbone. Has this been ruled out for some compelling reason? Also there are some other useful features that could be explored if this were to be implemented, which I'm happy to elaborate on if if this direction is not dead in the water.\n\nThanks very much.\n"

    "body": "Hi,\n\nI want to bring up the idea of forwarding event calls between different backbone objects (e.g. for bubbling up event calls).\n\nCurrently you will have to do something similar to this to forward events:\n\n```\nvar ListView = Backbone.View.extend({\n\n    tagName: \"ul\",\n\n    className: \"list\",\n\n    initialize: function() {\n        this.view = new ItemView();\n        this.view.on('show', this.showItem, this);\n    },\n\n    showItem: function(model) {\n        this.trigger('show:item', model);\n    }\n\n});\n\n```\n\nThe downside of this implementation is that you have to define lots of function which actually do not have any real logic inside.\nThe other way to use an anonymous function is not that readable:\n\n```\nvar ListView = Backbone.View.extend({\n\n    tagName: \"ul\",\n\n    className: \"list\",\n\n    initialize: function() {\n        this.view = new ItemView();\n        this.view.on('show', function(model) {\n            this.trigger('show:item', model);\n        }, this);\n    }\n\n});\n\n```\n\nMy wish would be some api change for the on method which would allow something like this:\n\n```\nvar ListView = Backbone.View.extend({\n\n    tagName: \"ul\",\n\n    className: \"list\",\n\n    initialize: function() {\n        this.view = new ItemView();\n        this.view.on('show', 'show:item', this);\n        // or alternative:\n        this.view.forward('show', 'show:item', this);\n    }\n\n});\n\n```\n\nThe downside would now be that the event system would be somehow coupled to another context where there is no guarantee if the new context supports the event api. However it would really improve code which has to bubble up lots of different event chains....\n\nRegards, \nbodo\n"

    "body": "Here is my predicament:\n\nWe have a number of frontend-only and backend-only routes (that is, content is generated via frontend Backbone views or backend server-rendered content).\n\nFor those backend routes, we still want Backbone to initialize because we use it for various page activities and handle navigation between frontend pages. The only thing special about our backend routes is the server pre-renders some HTML content into the body (think legacy apps, SEO, etc). Backbone works great out-of-the-box for PushState-enabled browsers in the above environment.\n\nThe problem is non-PushState browsers. Backbone intelligently swaps out URL fragments when Backbone history is started in the presence of a non-PushState browser:\n`https://zapier.com/app/support` `->` `https://zapier.com/app/#support`\n\nThis causes a full-page refresh in non-PushState browsers. Because of the hash `#`, the server is not sent the fragment. The server only sees `https://zapier.com/app/` and cannot know which backend content may need to be loaded on the second round trip.\n\nWe are working around this by using two routers, re-starting history between the router initialization, and faking some browser environment variables for Backbone:\n\n```\n# light routing starts here, light routing is for backend-only routes\n# fake pushState existence so Backbone won't auto-redirect\nif not window.history.pushState?\n   window.history.pushState = (() -> return)\nlightRouter = new LightRouter()\nlightRouteFound = Backbone.history.start {pushState: false, root: '/'}\n\n# normal backbone routing starts here\n# restart history so it picks up on a second set of new non-light routes\nBackbone.history.stop()\nrouter = new Router()\nrouteFound = Backbone.history.start {pushState: true, root: '/'}\n\n# load 404 page if no initial route matched the URL in the address bar\nrouter.notfound() if not routeFound and not lightRouteFound\n```\n\nI am curious what other solutions exist and if Backbone should be handling this scenario.\n"

    "body": "Hi all,\n\nWe've been leveraging the Deferred objects returned from Backbone.sync calls extensively in our application, and have found those to be very convenient, particularly when views depend on multiple models.  \n\nOne case we've struggled with is when we have nested Backbone views, we're forced to provide both the collection instance and deferred object to the child view constructor:\n\n```\nvar View1 = Backbone.View.extend({\n    render:function () {\n        var collection = new Backbone.Collection();\n        collection.url = '/path/to/resources';\n\n        var deferred = collection.fetch();\n        var subview1 = new Subview1({collection:collection, deferred:deferred}).render();\n        this.$el.append(subview1.el);\n\n        deferred.done(this.onCollectionFetched);\n\n        return this;\n    },\n\n    onCollectionFetched:function (collection) {\n        // do stuff with collection\n    }\n});\n\nvar Subview1 = Backbone.View.extend({\n    initialize:function () {\n       this.collection = this.options.collection;\n       this.deferred = this.options.deferred;\n    },\n\n    render:function () {\n        this.deferred.done(this.onCollectionFetched);\n        return this;\n    },\n\n    onCollectionFetched:function (collection) {\n        // do stuff with collection\n    }\n});\n```\n\nThe example above is fairly trivial, but quickly becomes complex has the hierarchy grows (particularly if certain views in the hierarchy should not be blocked from rendering based on data not being ready).  It would be nice if the deferred would be modified slightly such that the collection (or model) was provided as the first argument to the callbacks:\n\n```\nvar View1 = Backbone.View.extend({\n    render:function () {\n        var collection = new Backbone.Collection();\n        collection.url = '/path/to/resources';\n\n        var deferred = collection.fetch();\n        var subview1 = new Subview1({deferred:deferred});\n\n        deferred.done(this.onCollectionFetched);\n\n        return this;\n    },\n\n    onCollectionFetched:function (collection) {\n        // do stuff with collection\n    }\n});\n\nvar Subview1 = Backbone.View.extend({\n    initialize:function () {\n       this.collection = this.options.collection;\n       this.deferred = this.options.deferred;\n    },\n\n    render:function () {\n        this.deferred.done(this.onCollectionFetched);\n        return this;\n    },\n\n    onCollectionFetched:function (collection) {\n        // do stuff with collection\n    }\n});\n\n```\n\nI've attached a pull request to this issue illustrating a potential fix, but am certainly open to suggestions and other approaches to take.\n\nThanks,\nPhil\n"

This is a problem because the myCustomParameter properties get copied into myModel.attributes.  I don't want this to happen.  I temporarily decided to override the constructor() function to handle my custom object.  This adds complexity because my overridden constructor still has to call the super-class's constructor.  This is doable but ugly in my opinion.\n\nMy final solution is to explicitly state the parameters that Backbone uses by default and add my custom parameter afterward.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n/**\n* The Model's initialize method.\n* @param attributes Attributes are added to Backbone.Model.attributes.\n* @param options Options are added to Backbone.Model.options.\n* @param myCustomParameter A custom parameter that I don't want copied to the attributes or options.\n*/\ninitialize: function(attributes, options, myCustomParameter) {\n}\n```\n\nTo create this model you would call it like this:\n\n```\nvar myModel = new MyModel(null, null, myCustomParameter);\n```\n\nThis keeps all of Backbone's functionality and allows me to properly extend it.\n\nI ran into a similar problem with views and my solution is similar where I explicitly state Backbone's default parameters:\n\n```\n/**\n* The View's initialize method.\n* @param options Options are added to Backbone.View.options.\n* @param myViewModel A custom parameter that I don't want copied to the options.\n*/\ninitialize: function(options, myViewModel) {\n}\n```\n\nCollections work similarly with \"models\" and \"options\" parameters.\n\nIt would be great if the documentation talked more about the initialize method and stressed a standardized way of using it.  I feel like the initialize method should always be called with the parameters that Backbone uses by default and then you should add your own parameters afterward.  This is clean and keeps all of Backbone's functionality while allowing you to extend it at will.\n"

Module.exports is private to the module, so you can never inject anything into Backbone's root namespace currently. \n\nThis came for me because I was experimenting with rendering backbone views on the server, and needed to inject stubs for document.createElement. Currently there is no way to do this, since the global scope is effectively completely private.\n"

    "body": "I've encountered a peculiar issue when dealing with Backbone routing.\n\nOur app is being hosted in `example.com/photo/index.php`, and we'd like to hook an event on it which when triggered, appear in the address bar as `example.com/photo/<ID>`. Below is how we set up our rewrite rule androuter settings:\n\n```\nRewriteRule ^/photo/([0-9]+)?$ /photo/index.php/photo/$1 [L]\n```\n\n**Inside Backbone.Router.extend:**\n\n```\nroutes: {\n    'photo/:ID': 'viewPhoto'\n},\n```\n\n**After router has been instantiated:**\n\n```\n$(function() {\n    Backbone.history.start({\n        pushState: 'pushState' in window.history,\n        root: '/'\n    });\n});\n```\n\nThis works great in Firefox/Chrome/Safari, but in IE9 you have to access the event hook with `example.com/photo/#photo/<ID>`, which is not very cool.\n\nSo we tried toggling the pushState option on (`pushState: true`) and hope it could help, but now whenever accessing `example.com/photo/<ID>` in IE9, page will be redirected to `example.com/#photo/<ID>` instead, and actually displaying the content of `example.com/index.php`.\n\nI suppose (?) this can be a non-issue if we change the event hooking URL to something like `example.com/photo/view/<ID>`, however we can't touch that part.\n\nIs there anyway to make either `example.com/photo/<ID>`, `example.com/#photo/<ID>`, or `example.com/photo/#<ID>` working as expected under IE9, with or without pushState?\n"

I've seen examples online where people hook up this flag to Modernizr.history so it gets set to false for IE which makes sense with the current variable name but not the behavior I am seeing.\n\nIn that context of setting pushState to true for IE to get the hash url to auto update I am finding everything works great except if you pass querystring variables along with you hash URL Ex:\n\nhttp://test.url.net/#portfolio/PyUP6R9 works fine\nhttp://local.pathbrite.net/?asdf=sdfsdf#portfolio/PyUP6R9 redirects to http://local.pathbrite.net/?asdf=sdfsdf#. \n\nI tracked this strange behavior to:\nvar atRoot  = (loc.pathname == this.options.root) && !loc.search;\nin the Backbone.history.start method. Its set to always expect the web app is not at site root if there is a querystring present which does not make any sense to me. In my context a querystring for analytics is present which should not effect Backbone's atRoot logic. My solution was to comment out the && !loc.search. \n\nTLDR: It seems Backbone.history.start only considers you at web app root if you don't have a querystring present. This is causing my IE urls with querystring+hash to lose the hash value.\n"

The docs say:\n\n```\nIf the attributes are valid, don't return anything from validate; if they are invalid,\nreturn an error of your choosing. It can be as simple as a string error\nmessage to be displayed, or a complete error object that describes the error\nprogrammatically. If validate returns an error, set and save will not continue,\nand the model attributes will not be modified.\n```\n\nSince all coffeescript methods return a value this is confusing.  An update that explicitly indicates what types of values indicate success would have been helpful.\n"

    "body": "Hi,\n\nI've just started using Backbone and so I thought I would take it for a test spin on a basic login form.\n\nThe login form consists of a username and a password. \n\nI'm using Backbone to hijax the form's submit event, validate the fields and then send the data over to a PHP script (which currently does nothing but check whether the HTTP request was a `GET`, `HEAD`, `POST`, `PUT` and then just `echo`'s out a message relevant to the request type and then I was hoping to get that message back to my JavaScript (much like I would do with a standard AJAX request) and then act upon the response.\n\nSo my PHP code looks like the following (currently)...\n\n``` php\n<?php\n    switch ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']) {\n        case 'GET':\n            echo(\"The GET request\");\n            break;\n\n        case 'HEAD':\n            echo(\"The HEAD request\");\n            break;\n\n        case 'POST':\n            echo(\"The POST request\");\n            break;\n\n        case 'PUT':\n            echo(\"The PUT request\");\n            break;\n\n        default:\n            echo(\"None of the known requests\");\n            break;\n    }\n?>\n```\n\n...and my

the POST is being successful (e.g. the `200 OK` response), but all the `line 34` functions being displayed I'm not sure why that's happening? Line 34 is the `console.log` from my Model's error handler `handle_errors`?\n\nIf you look at my View file you'll see...\n\n``` js\nthis.model.save({\n    error: function(){\n        console.log('error');\n    },\n    success: function(){\n        console.log('success');\n    }\n});\n```\n\n...this itself is confusing because reading through the documentation it isn't 100% clear on how `save` should work and whether arguments are optional + I've seen `save` used in multiple different ways...\n\n``` js\n// From Addy Osmani Backbone book\nthis.save({done: !this.get(\"done\")});\n\n// Also from Addy Osmani Backbone book\ntodo.save(function(err) {\n    if (!err) {\n        return console.log(\"created\");\n    }\n});\n\n// Backbone documentation\nbook.save();\n\n// Backbone documentation\nbook.save({author: \"Teddy\"});\n\n// Backbone documentation\nbook.save(\"author\", \"F.D.R.\", {error: function(){ ... }});\n```\n\n...in the last Backbone documentation example you have the same object with `error` and `success` properties (as seen in my own version), but you have passed through the attribute and associated value where as I've left that blank - would that be a problem or does `save` allow that?\n\nIn Addy Osmani's versions he calls `save` and passes in the data to be changed, and in his second example he has a different syntax for calling `save` with no attributes but handling errors?\n\nSo which is the right way?\n\nThis has me very confused.\n\nThanks.\n"

My goal for Stickit was/is to conform to Backbone's style and to fit naturally within Backbone's core functionality. You can read more at the following github:\n\nhttp://nytimes.github.com/backbone.stickit/\n\nI respect the Backbone community's (and jeremy's) worldview which prizes minimalism and uniformity: if a high threshold of users won't use a feature or if a feature feels out of place, then they won't consider it. Model binding is a popular feature, but it has been hard to envision where it would fit in with Backbone's hands-off approach to rendering. Where other libraries/frameworks and plugins have failed by moving model binding configuration into the DOM/presentation layer, Stickit was designed to keep configuration in the place that it should be - in the JavaScript and in the context of the view controller which encapsulates the element and model.\n\nI was thinking about drawing up a pull for Backbone which included a model binding implementation like Stickit, but I would like to get opinions and ideas from the community first.\n\nThoughts?\n"

    "body": "There seems to be a lot of confusion about DOM rendering related to templates as backbone is expecting an element on creation. For example this question on SO: \nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/11594961/backbone-not-this-el-wrapping\n\nAnd these two previous issues:\nhttps://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/issues/546\nhttps://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/issues/1180\n\nCurrently calling setElement doesn't change the DOM at all, only the $el associated with the backbone view.\n\n``` javascript\nsetElement: function(element, delegate) {\n      if (this.$el) this.undelegateEvents();\n      this.$el = element instanceof Backbone.$ ? element : Backbone.$(element);\n      this.el = this.$el[0];\n      if (delegate !== false) this.delegateEvents();\n      return this;\n}\n```\n\nInstead it could call jquery's replaceWith on the element which would also cause the DOM to update correctly:\n\n``` javascript\nsetElement: function(element, delegate) {\n      if (this.$el) {        \n        this.undelegateEvents();\n        this.$el.replaceWith(element);  // <----- added this line ----->\n      }\n      this.$el = element instanceof Backbone.$ ? element : Backbone.$(element);\n      this.el = this.$el[0];\n      if (delegate !== false) this.delegateEvents();\n      return this;\n}\n```\n\nThis works very well if you want meta-data on your top level template items such as:\n\n``` html\n<li data-id=\"{id}\" class=\"well\" style=\"list-style:none\">\n    Campus: {id} {name}\n</li>\n```\n\nWith this change one can call: setElement(renderedTemplate); \nBefore this change it is necessary to call:\n\n``` javascript\nvar old = this.$el;\nthis.setElement(renderedTemplate);\nold.replaceWith(this.$el);\n```\n\nNot a big deal, but it does highly confuse some new users. I'd be happy to issue a pull request with the one-line addition to setElement, but wasn't sure if this automatic functionality would be desired by everyone. I can't think of a downside but perhaps there are ones other than performance.\n\nThoughts?\n"

A collection of contacts ( known users)\n2. A collection of search results (unkown users)\n\nThe switching between these two collections is done by the CollectionRepository. Now I would like to inform the views when an item gets added, removed or reset => bind the internal backbone events to the view.\n\nThis part is a bit tricky because the collections change whereas the view listener is the same. That is the reason why I wanted to extend the event functionality in my CollectionRepository also to handle the collection events. The benefit would be that the view only has to listen on the collectionrepository totally independent from how much collections are active. \nThe concrete implementation would just be a reference of this._callbacks to the callback list of the collections.\n\nHere is the example:\n\n```\n    var ContactsRepository = Core.Repository.extend({\n\n        initialize: function() {\n            // add the users-search-collection and the contacts-collection\n            // to our repositories hash\n            this.repositories.users = new Users();\n            this.repositories.contacts = new Contacts();\n\n            // reference each collection to the same object\n            // this is the part what fails...\n            this.each(function(repository) {\n                repository._callbacks = this._callbacks = {};\n            });\n\n            // set the user collection to the current one\n            this.switch('users');\n\n            // some other global event system handling the search field\n            events.on('contacts:search:query', this.searchQuery, this);\n            events.on('contacts:search:cancel', this.searchCancel, this);\n\n            console.log(this);\n        },\n\n        searchQuery: function(query) {\n            if (query === '') return;\n\n            this.repositories.users.query = query;\n            this.repositories.users.fetch({ success: function() {\n                this.switch('users');\n            }.bind(this) });\n        },\n\n        searchCancel: function(event) {\n            this.switch('contacts');\n        }\n\n    });\n\n    return ContactsRepository;\n```\n\nWhen I parse manually the log of the whole repository object I find that the this._callbacks contains callbacks whereas the collections don't...\n\nHi, I hope this isn' to unimportant to get an answer on github it is just that I already failed with getting an answer where else :(\n\nRegards,\nBodo\n"

    "body": "A similar issue was brought up here: https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/issues/914\n\nWhen you set a single attribute, validate is called, but all attributes of the model are passed, instead of just the one(s) which were updated.\n\nYou can see the issue in action here:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/jasonmcaffee/TWpjM/6/\n\nThe problem lies in the Backbone _validate function, which is passed only the attribute(s) which was modified, but all the attributes are merged together before calling validate. \n\nThis change was added with this commit: https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/commit/ab164c450da4d5c883d5b2b2817fa6a416a4b55a\n\n``` javascript\n_validate: function(attrs, options) {\n      if (options.silent || !this.validate) return true;\n      attrs = _.extend({}, this.attributes, attrs);  //<-- why is this done? It prevents the ability to validate a single attribute.\n      var error = this.validate(attrs, options);\n  ...\n```\n\nWhy does updating 1 attribute justify validating the entire model?\n\nThere are several cases where it is beneficial to set and validate a single property. \nFor instance, validating an input on a form when input blur occurs, so you can provide immediate feedback to the user indicating that the field is invalid.\n"

Currently this has to be done manually, inside init or somewhere similar:\n\n```\nBackbone.View.extend({\n    init: function() {\n        this.model.on('change', this.handleModelChange);\n    }\n```\n\nWhy not apply the same mechanism for models (and collections)?  It would work very naturally:\n\n```\nBackbone.View.extend({\n    events: {\n        'model change: 'handleModelChange', // style #1\n        'this.model change: 'handleModelChange', // style #2\n        '{model} change: 'handleModelChange', // style #3\n                                                                        // etc.\n```\n\nIn a similar ticket, the following arguments were made against this idea, but I'd like to dispute them:\n- \"You often have a view listening to events on one, two or three models, or two or three collections.\"\n  You don't see Backbone ditching support for options.model and options.collection just because a view _could_ use multiple models/collections, right?  Making things better for most of your users/use cases doesn't hurt the rest of them in any way.\n- \"You usually don't have very many distinct events to be listened for in a single view. Often, it's just change.\"\n  It's VERY common to have that change hookup, and providing a more convenient way of doing it would make the library better.  Plus, there are plenty of cases where people bind multiple model events (eg. change:foo, change:bar, and change:baz).\n- \"Most importantly, unlike Views and the DOM, Views aren't the only type of objects that listen for model events. Other models also listen, as do controller objects and so on.\"\n  Right, and jQuery provides a way to bind events, so Backbone should just stay out of the event business, right?  Of course not.  Views _do_ listen to model events a ton, so why make that particular binding harder just because some other possible way of binding events exists?\n"

    "body": "There is either a bug in the intended functionality or a documentation issue with Event#off.  The docs state:\n\n``` javascript\n// Removes the `onChange` callback for all events.\nobject.off(null, onChange);\n\n// Removes all callbacks for `context` for all events.\nobject.off(null, null, context);\n\n// Removes all callbacks on `object`.\nobject.off();\n```\n\nThe problem is that if you ever pass null as the first argument, you will actually remove ALL event listeners (collection-related event listeners as well on models).  The way it works and the way it is described above that code snippet states:\n    If no event is specified, all event callbacks on the object will be removed.\n\nI personally like the possibility of removing all event handlers for a given context but understand the requirements that imposes.\n"

    "body": "I don't think I was communicating this well, so I tried to write up my thoughts on it and hopefully it is convincing. Would love to know what you guys think.\n\n---\n\nFor the most part, you can augment Backbone however you want easily and everything is peachy. But changing the initial Backbone configuration logic is not one of those cases. \n\nIt's common practice to make \"base\" classes when using Backbone so that your customatizations apply to all of your app's classes. Instead of extending from `Backbone.Model`, you always extend from `BaseModel`.\n\nThat works amazingly for customization on a per-class level. What I mean by that is that if you have an `AuthorModel`, `BookModel`, and `PageModel`, they will all need different initialization logic. All you need to do is extend from `BaseModel` and then write a custom `initialize` function in each of those models.\n\nIt also works well for customization on a class-wide level for anything post-configuration. By that I mean that despite `AuthorModel` and `BookModel` being significantly different, they might both make use of a `cleanAttributes` method you've defined in `BaseModel`.\n\nWhere the whole thing breaks down is when you want to do customize the configuration on class-wide level. There's nothing to hook into to augment the configuration logic of anything that extends from `BaseModel` before `initialize` is called. Say I want to change the way `BaseModel` works a bit by copying the options that get passed in onto `this.options` to match how Views treat options. Or maybe I want to add a way for `BaseModel` to store extra UI state in a `this.state` property instead of inside `attributes`. Or maybe I want to have my models inherit `defaults` all the way up the chain by `_.default`ing them.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that there are four main places you might want to hook into to add custom logic in to a Backbone class. The first two are handled fine as is, but there isn't a nice way to handle the third:\n\n**Before anything is configured:** Here you could provide your own augmented `constructor`. (But this could be done by augmenting `_configure` instead, which I also think is preferable.)\n\n**After it is initialized:** This is completely up to you, and most of what you're writing as a Backbone user fits in this category.\n\n**After things are configured, but before initialize:** Backbone doesn't give you a nice way to do this! There are only two annoying ways and one incomplete way I could think to do it:\n#### Augment the constructor. (incomplete)\n\n```\nconstructor : function (attributes, options) {\n    this._configureOptions();\n    Backbone.Model.prototype.constructor.apply(this, arguments);\n}\n```\n\nThat does work, but only if your added logic doesn't rely on anything else Backbone does in its `constructor`. For example, if you need to access `this.attributes` which have been parsed and attached directly to the instance, you're out of luck. Or if need to reference the `cid`? tough.\n#### Re-call your logic in every single initialize method. (annoying)\n\n```\nvar AuthorModel = BaseModel.extend({\n\n    initialize : function (attributes, options) {\n        this._configureOptions();\n        // Real initialization logic.\n    }\n});\n\nvar BookModel = BaseModel.extend({\n\n    initialize : function (attributes, options) {\n        this._configureOptions();\n        // Real initialization logic.\n    }\n});\n\nvar PageModel = BaseModel.extend({\n\n    initialize : function (attributes, options) {\n        this._configureOptions();\n        // Real initialization logic.\n    }\n});\n```\n\nYeah I _could_ do that. But I shouldn't need to keep copying and pasting that code around all over my codebase when I know upfront that I want everything that extends `BaseModel` to be configured that way.\n#### Give up initialize and create a new initialize. (annoying)\n\n```\ninitialize : function (attributes, options) {\n    this._configureOptions();\n    this.start.apply(this, arguments);\n}\n\nstart : function (attributes, options) {\n    // Real initialization logic.\n}\n```\n\nThat's also not great. Everyone who reads my code needs to be informed that what they have always known as `initialize` is now `start`. Any time I'm talking/reading about Backbone I have to mentally convert `initialize` to `start` and back. And if you accidentally override `initialize` instead, you might not even realize it until things get weird because the instance wasn't configurated properly.\n\n---\n\nSo how should it be done? My suggestion is to make all the Backbone classes have a `_configure` method that does the configuration that happens before `initialize` in the `constructor`. With a `_configure` method the problem is easily solved and you end up with this:\n\n```\n_configure : function (attributes, options) {\n    Backbone.Model.prototype._configure.apply(this, arguments);\n    // Add custom logic here.\n}\n```\n\nYou just augment `_configure` in your `BaseModel` and then you don't ever need to touch it again! All of your other extended Models will get the augmented configuration options. Class-wide configuration solved!\n\nLook familiar? That's because `Backbone.View` already has a `_configure` method that makes this kind of augmentation incredibly easy. But the other Backbone classes should get `_configure` too.\n\nAnd the `_configure` solution doesn't have any effects on the rest of Backbone source.\n### Bonus: it's great for mixins too!\n\nThe best way I've found to add functionality to an existing Backbone class without extending a completely new class is the mixin pattern. It's like the jQuery plugins of Backbone. Having a `_configure` would make it extremely easy for mixins to be grafted onto existing classes (regardless of whether it's a View, Model, Collection or Router!).\n\n```\n// Augmented `_configure` to call `_inherit`\nvar _configure = this.prototype._configure;\nthis.prototype._configure = function () {\n  this._inherit(this.inherits || []);\n  _configure.apply(this, arguments);\n};\n```\n\nSince the classes all have the `_configure` method, you can attach your custom logic to each of them the same way in your mixin. And then when you package your mixin for others, they can add inheritance to any class they want with the same syntax:\n\n```\ninheritMixin.call(BaseView);\ninheritMixin.call(DropdownModel);\ninheritMixin.call(AppRouter);\n```\n"

As it is stated in the backbone-documentation the parse-Method of the individual models is called after the collection has parsed the server-response. This behavior can be suppressed by setting options.parse=false.\n\nMy question would be, nevertheless, why is the individual parse method of the models being called from the collection, even in case the collection already parsed the xml-response?\n\nThanks :-)\nTobias\n"

Backbone.Model uses the id attribute internally to contain the unique identifier of the object contained in the model. However when using with module.exports and commonjs, there is a conflict because commonjs also uses the id attribute. This makes things like model.isNew() not work as expected. This can be worked around using exports.Model instead of module.exports.\n\nIt could perhaps be useful to change the Backbone.Model.id attribute to _id or similar to avoid conflicts with commonjs.\n\nI hope this has helped anyone else who was confused by this.\n"

    "updated_at": "2012-12-07T20:17:35Z",
    "body": "This is nitpicking about the docs, so be warned. ;)\n\nFor some reason people name their Backbone collections with an uppercase letter at the beginning. This is so widespread across several Backbone projects nowadays that it\u2019s almost a convention.\n\nExcept that this is against all JavaScript naming conventions I\u2019ve seen in last decade. Every style guide I know recommends this naming for constructors or namespaces only (correct me if I missed something).\n\nIn the documentation examples the naming of collections is inconsistent. Most of the times they are lowercase, but in some method examples they suddenly turn uppercase:\n\nhttp://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Collection-fetch\nhttp://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Collection-create\nhttp://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Collection-reset\n\n`Accounts.fetch()` might make sense at first glance, but it does not at the second glance. This may remind people of Rails\u2019 `ActiveRecord`, but it\u2019s not like that. In Rails, it would be `Account.all()`. This makes sense since it\u2019s a class with a static method which just returns a list synchronously without changing the (overall) state of `Account`. However, `Accounts.fetch()` doesn\u2019t make sense: It does not return a list, but an Ajax promise. `fetch` is not a pure function, it fills `Accounts` itself asynchronously.\n\nThe Todo example spreads this unconventional naming:\nhttps://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/blob/master/examples/todos/todos.js#L80\n\nEven as a pro JavaScripter, I find this naming confusing:\n- `Todo`\n- `Todos`\n- `TodoList`\n\nCould you guess the difference between `TodoList` and `Todos`? Could you guess that one is a class and one an instance of this very class? So which is which?\n\nYou could say that `Todos` is somehow a singleton since it\u2019s a global, central storage. Fine, but I don\u2019t know a language or framework which names singleton _instances_ like that. I could understand this notion if a \u201cmaster\u201d collection was purely used for querying (`get`, `where`, `find`, `map`, `reduce` etc.), rather then manipulating it as a list. But Backbone collections are more than that, and they are manipulated almost always in practice.\n\nThe identifier `Todos` is used mostly in the `AppView`. The `AppView` is actually a list view (for the most part). So it should have the todos collection as `this.collection`. This removes the need to have so many `Todos.something` identifiers.\n\nBtw, I\u2019d love to see a complete overhaul of the Todo example like someone did it here:\n\nhttp://wekeroad.com/2011/08/11/the-backbonejs-todo-list-sample-refactored-part-1\nhttp://wekeroad.com/2011/08/12/the-backbone-js-todo-list-refactored-part-2\n\nSee also #642 - please go on where the contributor started, this is so important that the maintainers should take over IMHO.\n\nI cannot stress how important good example code in the docs and a good example project are for Backbone beginners to get pointed into the right direction.\n"

So `/foo` is actually used and saved to `History#fragment`.\n- On `popstate`, `History#checkUrl` is called. It calls `History#getFragment`. This method always _removes_ the `root` and returns `foo`.\n- `History#checkUrl` compares `/foo` with `foo`. Since they differ, it assumes the URL was changed. Therefore the URL is routed using `History#loadUrl`.\n\nThis issue might seem contrived (why push the same URL twice?), but it actually caused a problem in our application. The background is: For some reason, latest Chrome triggers a `popstate` event without user input right after some `navigate`/`pushState` calls. I don\u2019t know why and need to investigate further, I cannot reproduce this behavior with simple code like the one above.\n\nAnyway, it should not be a problem for our app since the accidentally popped path is always the same as the current.

    "body": "I was wondering what the rationale is for a couple of elements of Backbone's design:\n1. For `change` events, callback method signature is `( model, options )`, whereas for `change:[attribute]` it's `( model, value, options )`.  I'm thinking that if there were a situation where it's desirable to use the same callback for both types of change events, it would be helpful if `options` was always passed in the same position.\n2. For `change:attr`, why pass the new value and not the attr name?  The model is passed anyway, so if you have the attr name and you want the new value, it's trivial to call `model.get( attr )`.  But with the current setup, there's no straighforward way to get the attr name, is there?  It seems to me that if the callback received the attr name instead of value, that would open up more dynamic possibilities for using the same callbacks for multiple attributes. \n\nIn any case, I don't think the documentation does a good job of explaining this.  I eventually went through it more thoroughly and found that the information about the 2 different callback signatures is there, but I think it should be mentioned in the `Model.set()` section (either inline or via link).  I just submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/pull/1360) that links to F.A.Q > Catalog of Events from the `Model.set()` section.\n"

    "body": "Hi.\n## Description\n\nWe have a very simple backbone model/collection thing going on in our application. We initialize it like below.\n\n``` javascript\nvar models = {}; // Will contains all Backbone models, sort of a global dictionnay\n\n$(document).ready(function() {\n  models.imagesCollection = new ImagesCollection(\"${ownerId}\"); // this is in the context of a jsp page, so that's an el expression\n  models.imagesCollection.fetch();\n}\n```\n\n``` javascript\nvar Img = Backbone.Model.extend({});\n\nvar ImagesCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({  \n    model : Img,\n    url: '/dam/imageViewList/',\n    initialize: function(annonceurId) {\n        this.url += annonceurId;\n    }\n});\n```\n\nSo the .fetch() on the collection calls this url : `/dam/imageViewList/<a variable>`. This URL may return two things, depending on the value of the variable :\n- HTTP status 200 with an array of JSON object, with the mime type application/json\n- HTTP status 404, because the ressource identified by the variable value does not exists. The body of this request is an empty array (like so [ ] ) with a content-type of application/json.\n## The error\n\nFor this last case (404 + empty array), the weirdest thing happen : **backbone creates one model in the collection. This model has no attributes**. This results in a page showing only one item, and one item with empty attributes is not pretty. We use html templates to populate the view with the models. So again, there is one model in this case, even if there is an empty array.\n\nI guess this is a backbone bug somewhere because, well, the server returns an empty array. Why creating one model if there is an empty array ?\n## A workaround\n\nUsing error callbacks of the collection, but ... that's hacking the framework :(\n## To reproducce\n\nThe hardest part to reproduce is that you will need a server that can serve 2 urls :\n- /reproduce/blabla => returns http 200, with the json mime type and a non empty array of json objects (the array must be of size strictly superior to one)\n- /reproduce/404 => returns http 404, with the json mime type and an empty array [  ]\n\nThen, use this html page (change the scripts includes of course) and switch at line 19 the value of \"changeMe!!!\" to \"blabla\" then \"404\". You will see that with the value \"404\", your console outputs : \"1, this should never be equals to 1\"\n\n``` html\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"/resources/javascript/libs/underscore/underscore-min.js\"></script>\n        <script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"/resources/javascript/libs/backbone/backbone-min.js\" ></script >\n        <script>\n            var models = {}; // Will contains all Backbone models, sort of a global dictionnay\n\n            var Img = Backbone.Model.extend({});\n\n            var ImagesCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({  \n                model : Img,\n                url: '/reproduce/',\n                initialize: function(annonceurId) {\n                    this.url += annonceurId;\n                }\n            });\n\n            $(document).ready(function() {\n                models.imagesCollection = new ImagesCollection(\"changeMe!!!!\");\n                models.imagesCollection.fetch();\n                console.log(models.imagesCollection.length, \"this should never be equals to one\");\n            });\n        </script>\n        </head>\n    <body>\n            dude, dafuq\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nNow I'll try and see why this happens.\n"

    "title": "Unable to bind an event to a view, where the event is using the (\"parent > child\") selector",

    "updated_at": "2016-09-02T10:58:48Z",
    "body": "So I love Backbone.js, but I'm a little shocked that there currently isn't a way to bind a View method to an event that happens on one of View.el's immediate children.  Let me explain:\n\n```\n// How we usually define events in a view\nView = Backbone.View({\n\n    el: $(\".elements.main\"),\n\n    events: {\n        \"click .element\": \"do_something\"\n    },\n\n   do_something: function() {}\n\n});\n```\n\nThis works fine until you encounter a situation where you only want the immediate children of \".elements.main\" to have the click event.  A good example of this is when you have a tree of data, like so:\n\n```\n.elements.main\n    --.element\n        --.elements\n            --.element\n            --.element\n                --.elements\n                    -.element\n            --.element\n    --.element\n```\n\nSee how every \".element\" could potentially have an \".elements\" child that holds more elements?  So using the View declaration from above, by binding the click event to \".element\", we would be binding that click event to every \".element\" tag in the entire tree.  And when each .element is represented by an actual element in the DOM this can cause a number of problems, because you will undoubtedly have methods that use the current view's DOM object(View.el), and it's possible that a trigger of an event could change the wrong object.  So the next logical step is to declare something like this:\n\n```\n// How we usually define events in a view\nView = Backbone.View({\n\n    el: $(\".elements.main\"),\n\n    events: {\n        \"click > .element\": \"do_something\"\n    },\n\n   do_something: function() {}\n\n});\n```\n\nNotice the greater than sign.  I used the jQuery (\"parent > child\") selector in order to try to only pinpoint the immediate children.  But it doesn't work..... Why?  JQuery's delegate function(used by View.delegateEvents() to call the bound methods with the correct context) does not play nicely with the (\"parent > child\") selector.  There were a lot of really terrible work-arounds that broke things for me like calling e.stopImmediatePropagation().  My eventual solution was putting this in the initialize method of my view:\n\n```\nmethod = _.bind(this.do_something, this);\nthis.$el.children(\".element\").delegate('.add_reply', 'click', method);\n```\n\nAnyway, this seems like a pretty basic feature to ask for, is there anyway this can get fixed?  I'm not experienced enough I feel to attempt to tackle it, but I was just mainly wondering if this issue has been looked at before?  Also are there any other potential fixes?\n"

    "body": "There's some awkward behavior in backbone's Collection.where() method.  Unlike Collection.get(), the where() operation operates on an identity comparison.  This is particularly problematic when dealing with integer ids - if you do a get operation, things will work fine either way, but if you do a where() operation it fails and you get stuck wondering what went wrong.\n\nThe most glaring example of this problem would be a router which grabs an ID out of the URL.  The id is therefore a string instead of a proper integer, and unless you take care to parseInt each route, it will cause failures down the line when it meets well formed integers in the model data.\n\nShould Collection.where() have its behavior loosened to accept string/number comparison?  Sanitizing all that data gets a bit onerous, considering all the possible ways this can accidentally be triggered.\n"

    "body": "Hi,\n\nI found this problem in my project. Take a look on how Backbone.View.$ function is implemented:\n\n``` javascript\n    // jQuery delegate for element lookup, scoped to DOM elements within the\n    // current view. This should be prefered to global lookups where possible.\n    $: function(selector) {\n      return this.$el.find(selector);\n    },\n```\n\nThis will of course work if we assume that view is composed of only one top-level DOM element and some other nested ones, e.g.:\n\n``` html\n<body>\n    <div class='my-view'>\n        <div class='something'></div>\n    </div>\n</body>\n```\n\n``` javascript\nvar SomeModel = Backbone.Model.extend({\n   // nothing\n});\nvar MyView = Backbone.View.extend({\n    el : '.my-view',\n    initialize : function() {\n        console.info('something', this.$('.something'));\n        console.info('my view', this.$('.my-view'));\n    }\n});\n\nvar model = new SomeModel();\nvar view = new MyView({ model : model });\n```\n\nIn such a case you will see console output:\n\n```\nsomething [div.something]\nmy view [ ]\n```\n\nBut in my project I cannot create views with only one root element. In my case I have a collection of items. Each item is represented as two table `<tr>` elements and has on corresponding view. I found that I'm not able to match any of the $el root elements! I found solution for my problem and would like to ask backbone community what do you think about to change this to what I'm suggesting.\n\nI changed this function to:\n\n``` javascript\n    $ : function(selector) {\n        return this.$el.filter(selector).add(this.$el.find(selector));\n    },\n```\n\nIf this is not acceptable for all selectors, maybe some argument could be added to switch between two selection modes (with root, and without root)?\n"

I am running this \"very simple\" example which I found on the Backbone site:\nhttps://github.com/L0stSoul/Training/tree/master/Backboneapp\n\nWhen I run it with jQuery 1.6.2 it works, however with jQuery 1.7.x it fails with the following error:\n\nChrome - Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'root' of undefined\n\nThe issue seems to be caused by a timing issue.  Regardless, from what I understand there could be scenarios where \"this.options\" is not initalized and in those situations, I feel like it should either fail explicitly or not at all.\n\nMy fix is as follows:\n\nBackbone.js - Line 1118:  Add a check for an undefined options collection:\n\n(typeof(this.options) != \"undefined\") &&\n\nSo the new line looks like this:\n\nif ((typeof(this.options) != \"undefined\") && !fragment.indexOf(this.options.root)) fragment = fragment.substr(this.options.root.length);\n\nThe code the causes the problem is here:\n\nvar NavigationRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({\n            _data: null,\n            _items: null,\n            _view: null,\n\n```\n        routes: {\n            \"info/:id\": \"showInfo\",\n            \"*actions\": \"defaultRoute\"\n        },\n        initialize: function (options)\n        {\n            var _this = this;\n            $.ajax({\n                url: \"/Content/New/test.json\",\n                dataType: 'json',\n                data: {},\n                async: false,\n                success: function (data)\n                {\n\n                    _this._data = data;\n                    _this._items = new ItemCollection(data);\n                    _this._view = new MenuView({ model: _this._items });\n                    _this._view.render();\n\n                    /// BAD - If this is called with jQuery 1.7 it fails, but with jQuery 1.6 it works.\n                    Backbone.history.loadUrl();\n                }\n\n            });\n\n            return this;\n        },\n        defaultRoute: function (actions)\n        {\n            this.showInfo(1);\n        },\n        showInfo: function (id)\n        {\n            var view = new ContentView({ model: this._items.at(id - 1) });\n            $(\".active\").removeClass(\"active\");\n            $(\"#item\" + id).addClass(\"active\");\n            view.render();\n        }\n    });\n\n    var navigationRouter = new NavigationRouter;\n    Backbone.history.start();\n```\n"

    "body": "In attempting to migrate some code to use a factory function instead of a return from constructor (#1094), I've run into a problem with `collection._prepareModel`.  The goal is to write a model with a factory function whose children will inherit it with the same semantics (returns the specified model, possibly after some custom logic).  For instance:\n\n``` javascript\nvar User = Model.extend();\nvar user = User.create();\nok(user instanceof User);\n```\n\nI first tried the following (#1148):\n\n``` javascript\nvar Model = Backbone.Model.extend({...}, {\n  create: function(attributes, options) {\n    ...\n    return new this(attributes, options);\n  }\n});\nvar Child = Model.extend(...);\nvar Collection = Backbone.Collection.extend({model: Child.create});\nvar collection = new Collection([{}]);\n```\n\nThis does not work.  The problem is that `_prepareModel` still uses `new` regardless of the intent behind `collection.model`.  Thus, the context will always be a new object and `create` will always fail.\n\nAnother choice is to use a custom `extend`, but I dismissed the idea altogether because it won't work with coffee-script (and is likely bad practice).  It seems that, with the current implementation, my only real choice is to manually set the create function on each model class.  This is rather awkward and inelegant.\n\nI think this requires that either `collection._prepareModel` stop using `new`, or I go back to return from constructor.  Thoughts?\n"

If a server-side validation fails, return a non-200 HTTP response code, along with an error response in text or JSON.\n\nWhen the server validation fails, I am sending a non-200 response with the error object, but still, the success callback is called.\n\nHere is the save function \n\n``` js\nthis.model.save(item, {\n  wait: true,\n  success: function (model, response) {\n    // even if there is a non-200 response this is being called\n    app.navigate('items/'+model.id, {trigger: true, replace: true})\n    self.undelegateEvents();\n  },\n  error: function (model, response) {\n    // doesn't get called when there is a non-200 response\n    self.undelegateEvents()\n    self.delegateEvents()\n  }\n});\n```\n\nAnd this is what I am doing on the server\n\n``` js\nimager.upload(req, res, function (err, files, cdnUri, res){\n  if (err) return res.json(err, 403)\n  item.image = { cdnUri : cdnUri, files : files }\n  item.save(function (err) {\n    // when there is an error, this is sent (which is non-200 response with error object)\n    if (err) return res.json(err.errors, 403) \n    res.json(item)\n  })\n}, 'items')\n```\n\nBut the above works fine when I don't send the error object in response. i.e, if I only send the response code `if (err) return res.send(403)`\n\nI am using backbone v0.9.2\n"

It's quite possible I'm missing something something here, I'm no Backbone expert.  The two approaches I've found are:\n\n1) Create a new model instance, specifying the the id in the constructor, and call fetch on it. This works, but has the problem that the initialize method has already been called when the model data is loaded. In my case, initialize does some stuff like creating child collections and populating them from attributes, but there's no data to work with yet because it hasn't been fetched. I considered using parse to do some of the init work, but the sequencing is reversed in the two cases - initialize is called first when creating a model then fetching, but parse is called first when a collection is doing the fetching. \n\n2) Use Collection.fetch with the \"add\" option set. This one is SO close to perfect, but there's no simple way to specify the ID of a model to load (in particular when using RESTful URLs where the ID is part of the base URL, not query string params). I sort of kludged it by specifying the \".url\" option on the call to fetch, and building the URL manually by concatenating the collection URL with the model ID. It works, but again seems clunky.\n\nOne solution would be to specify an ID to collection.fetch (maybe as simple as options.id). Then along with add: true, you would have simple incremental collection loading. \n\nOr maybe there's a better solution for single model fetching that solves issue 1) listed above.  \n"

The concept is similar to how animation is handled in jQuery, they queue would let each of the renders happen serially, as the user may expect. Otherwise there is this \"jarring\" rendering where you see flashes of content, that gets overwritten, etc...\n\nSimilar to this queue idea, I wonder if it would make sense to stop the renders from happening except for the last render requested. This may or may not make complete sense, but I think it could have some value -- and save some excessive traffic/hits to the REST server getting collections that it doesn't need, since they wouldn't be displayed.\n\nThoughts???\n"

You can see that commit here: https://github.com/leshill/backbone/commit/38f54ef2d7fe58b6f22848af08c6fe31428b306f\n\nIf this fixes a real issue with `Backbone.js`, then yes, that is a commit without a spec &mdash; pointers on how-to would be welcome :) Or I would be happy to refactor the `Router`, making it easier to spec in the process :)\n\nThanks for working on `Backbone.js`, we find it incredibly useful.\n"

    "body": "Backbone.Collection.reset and Backbone.Collection.add are clearly used for different things.  However, there are similarities between the two.  For one, both have a trigger (reset and add respectively) and both take a list of models as input.  The documentation states that reset could be used to bootstrap a collection during initial page load.  This example really doesn't make sense though because if a page is being loaded for the first time, won't the collection be empty anyway?  In fact, a much more realistic use case would be to refresh the entire collection after the page was already loaded.  Furthermore, you could just as easily use Backbone.Collection.add to bootstrap that collection in the beginning.\n\nHowever, using reset is appealing because you could technically use it to bootstrap initially and to refresh the collection at any point during runtime.  The question that I have is around the object that is returned from these two methods (reset and add).  The reset method includes an object with multiple keys, one of them being the models key which points to the array of models that were added during the reset method.  That key is really useful because you can use it to pass to a template for rendering.  Likewise, that same array, is also present in the add method.  This is where the behavior becomes different.\n\nThe reset method triggers the \"reset\" trigger and passes \"this\" back to whatever function is listening, plus options.  The \"this\" is the scope of the reset method, unless bound to a higher scope using a bind technique (I didn't look that far).  The reset trigger from the reset method differs from the add trigger in the add method in that instead of passing the \"this\" variable to listening functions, it passes instead, the models array.  I think it's a lot easier to deal with when the trigger passes the models array instead of passing the \"this\" context to the listening functions.\n\nOn line 746: if (!options.silent) this.trigger('reset', this, options);\n\nOn line 631: model.trigger('add', model, this, options);\n\nI understand that the reset method only throws the reset trigger one time, whereas the add method throws the add trigger for each model.  What though, is the usefulness of returning the \"this\" context to listening functions?  Aren't those functions just interested in the models: Array?  Ultimately those are going to get snagged and passed to a render function anyway.\n"

I can accomplish the first part using the `{silent: true}` option to `Model.set`, but when doing this, validations aren't run and callbacks aren't fired, so I don't easily know when my model transitions from valid to invalid.\n\nI could alternately use the default behavior, but then my model gets out of sync with what the user has entered. This is an issue if I have, for example, a save button for the view hooked up to my model. When the user clicks the save button, the most natural way to handle it seems to be to call `Model.save`, which will misleadingly succeed, because the invalid attribute value was not actually set on the model due to validation failure.\n\nPerhaps I'm just thinking about this backwards, but would it be crazy to add a `force` option to `Model.set` that would modify the default `set` behavior by just continuing to update the relevant attribute(s) even if validations fail (but still fire error events / callbacks)?\n"

    "body": "Ok so this is kind of hard to explain, but I will try and offer a test case that should be reproducible. I should also note that I discovered this in version 0.5.3. I know that there have been some changes to the way event binding works in subsequent versions, but it's worth checking out anyway.\n\nIt could also be a bug in Chrome, not sure.\n\nThe problem I discovered is that if I store a reference to a view on another view, and both views have a method with the same name, and I bind that method to an event with both views, I am unable to successfully unbind the event from the method on the referenced view.\n\nExample (please read comments):\n\n```\nvar ParentView = Backbone.View.extend({\n\n    views: {},\n\n    initialize: function () {\n        this.model.bind(\"myCustomEvent\", this.render, this);\n\n        _.bindAll(this, \"render\", \"onClose\");\n    },\n\n    render: function () {\n        console.log(\"parent just rendered\");\n    },\n\n    onClose: function () {\n        // this method gets called when I want to remove the view and unbind events\n\n        this.model.unbind(\"myCustomEvent\", this.render); // this works great\n    }\n\n});\n\nvar ChildView = Backbone.View.extend({\n\n    views: {},\n\n    initialize: function () {\n        this.model.bind(\"myCustomEvent\", this.render, this);\n\n        _.bindAll(this, \"render\", \"onClose\");\n    },\n\n    render: function () {\n        console.log(\"child just rendered\");\n    },\n\n    onClose: function () {\n        // this method gets called when I want to remove the view and unbind events\n\n        // In Chrome 17 I noticed that this.render is function() { [ Native Code ]}\n        // this.render !== ChildView.prototype.render, which is why the unbind fails on line 92 of Backbone.js\n        // In this case, you would not expect render to appear as a property of this, but in fact it does\n        // The expected behavior is for render to appear as a property on the prototype chain\n\n        this.model.unbind(\"myCustomEvent\", this.render); // this does not do anything\n    }\n\n});\n\nvar App = {\n    views: {}\n};\n\nApp.views.parent = new ParentView({\n    model: new MyCustomModel()\n});\n\nApp.views.parent.views.child = new ChildView({\n    model: new MyCustomModel()\n});\n\n// If I call App.views.parent.views.child.onClose() then render is not unbound from the myCustomEvent event. \n// I get a zombie view.\n```\n\nThe hack to solve this problem is to change the name of the referenced (child) view's render method. If I change it to, say, \"renderMe\" then it works properly. When inspecting the view, renderMe is not a property of the view itself, but instead is found one level up on the prototype chain where it is expected.\n\nI think there is a conflict going on with the prototype chain where method names are colliding.\n"

    "body": "I'd like to see a complete set of events for managing the state of communications to the persistance layer of collections and models. Currently, there's no way in Backbone out-of-the-box to fulfil this common requirement. We have a some loosely related events such as \"sync\" (which only triggers on save/delete, not on fetch) and \"error\" (which only triggers on save error), but these do not cover all of the common use cases.\n\nThe most common use case for these extra events is for updating the UI to reflect the state of the model or collection being acted on. There are other use cases though, depending on how the events are implemented (such as pre-processing the communication, or post-processing the returned data), though there's no predicting how such events could be used - models and collections may hook onto their own sync events.\n\nThere are already 4 requests for this feature on Github, which demonstrates that this is indeed a common requirement worthy of being included in Backbone.js...\n\nhttps://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/issues/477\nhttps://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/pull/206\nhttps://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/pull/542\nhttps://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/pull/583\n\nThe arguments against adding these hooks seem poor or ill-justified, and none of these issues or pull requests come to any real resolution. I think if Backbone wants to remain an unassuming bare-bone's framework, then it needs to provide more hook methods on which developers can use as foundations to build-on functionality, so users like me don't need to tread so heavily by overwriting core methods or using messier work-arounds.\n\nAs to how these sync events should be implemented is up for discussion, though I'd like to see at least 4 that should more-or-less correspond to the equivalent Ajax callbacks in jQuery. They should be before sync, successful sync, failed sync and complete sync. Actual event names can be for example, \"sync:before\", \"sync:complete\", \"sync:success\" and \"sync:error\". We shouldn't need additional events for #save and #fetch, as long as the type of operating can be determined through the use of the sync events (e.g. create, read, update, delete). The arguments provided by these events could be the operation type (as mentioned), the data/model/collection being operation on, and possibly an optional communication object, like the jQuery $.ajax object and the jqXHR response object.\n\nI'm anticipating the suggestion to use jQuery callbacks to manage event state, but this requires a lot more boilerplate and micro-management. In no fewer words, It's crap - I know because it's what I was doing. It either means you need to repeat yourself in all your objects, or otherwise, if it's put into a common prototype, all the children need to explicitly wrap the parents callbacks in any of their own callbacks. It gets fiddly and messy really quick. Events allow you to easily hook onto these states as many times as you want - It's set and forget. Set it in the constructor and it works no matter where in your view the state is changed, or in what backbone method. You even bind to the event in a parent object from which all your views inherit.\n\nSo please, can adding these events be more thoroughly considered?\n"

Why should the collection take precedence over the model itself? The model should have the final word about its own url, not the collection.\n\nSpecifically, line 371 of backbone 0.9.1 could be changed to:\n\n```\n  var base =  getValue(this, 'urlRoot') || getValue(this.collection, 'url') || urlError();\n```\n\ninstead of:\n\n```\n  var base = getValue(this.collection, 'url') || getValue(this, 'urlRoot') || urlError();\n```\n\nA use case where this would be valuable is where models can belong to multiple parents, for example files and folders. In this case file collection for a folder with id 3 might have a URL:\n\nfolders/3/files\n\nand POST to that url would create a new file object in that folder. Let's say the new file has id 11. However, the file's url is not:\n\nfolder/3/files/11\n\nbecause that file might also belong to many other folders. Therefore the files URL is likely:\n\nfiles/11\n\nIf the model's urlRoot property took priority over the collection's url, then we could insert logic into the urlRoot function that return the appropriate URL depending on wether or not the model is new. However, right now the collection's URL takes priority, and is not possible to return simple \"files\" as the base url (while the file is part of the collection) without overriding the url function itself.\n\nI would imagine there are other cases where this backwards-seeming behavior gets in the way.\n\nThere must be another side to this argument, but I don't see what it is? Why should the collection's url take priority over the model's urlRoot?\n"

The first option is ugly and the second option is often overkill because the standard collection class will suffice for all other needs. Therefore it would be very useful to be able to say:\n\nvar myCollection = new Backbone.Collection( jsonArrayOfModels, { model : MyModel } );\n\nWhere the collection constructor automatically sets the \"model\" attribute of the created collection to the value passed in to the options parameter (in this case, MyModel).\n\nOf course, it is relatively easy to derive your own \"BaseCollection\" object that works like this , but I image this is a common need and would help a lot of people if the built in collection object did this out of the box.\n"

Additionally, there is some funny logic here which to me looks like a bug:\n\n```\n  var triggerDestroy = function() {\n    model.trigger('destroy', model, model.collection, options);\n  };\n\n  if (this.isNew()) return triggerDestroy();\n```\n\nThe triggerDestroy() funciton has no return value, so destroy() ends up returning undefined for new models. Not sure if this is intended or not but the way the logic is written does not make it at all clear.\n\nAnyway, the primary problem is that the nice sytax mentioned above, using the error() method of the xhr object, fails in the case that the model is new. Generally speaking I don't think people will take into account this fringe case and it will end up breaking on sites already in production.\n\nNot sure the best way to solve this issue. Maybe just return a new xhr object instead of undefined in the case that the model is new?

Drupal is [moving in the direction](http://buytaert.net/the-future-is-a-restful-drupal) of a heavy focus  on REST and Service-oriented systems, and I believe Backbone could become a significant part of the Drupal stack.\n\nThe most signifiant limiting factor to Backbone's adoption in the Drupal community will probably be  the difference between the two projects licenses. Drupal is GPLv2 and all code hosted on Drupal.org must be GPL as well.  Drupal 7 now has a flexible API for handling external libraries, and we can facilitate the download of Backbone and Underscore individually using package.json-like makefiles, but the ideal is to be able to distribute Backbone with the Drupal Backbone module. Further, in the future I would love to see Backbone included in Drupal in the way jQuery currently is: as part of Drupal core, and for this there must be a GPL licensing option.\n\nWould it be possible to offer Backbone (and backbone) under a licensing scheme similar to the [jQuery Dual License](http://jquery.org/license/)?\n\nI don't think this would need to impact any current users of the product, as they can all choose MIT as their license of choice, but it would allow the GPL world to make full use of the foundation Backbone provides.\n\nBackbone's `extend` patterns makes it extremely powerful as a building block for framework-specific adaptation and integration, and a really hope you'll consider this licensing option.\n\nThank your.\n"

I may be misunderstanding how it should work.\n\nBasically, I tried\n`collection.create({ attribute: \"value\" })`\nthat will create a model instance in _prepareModel method and trigger \"error\" event on that instance, though I don't see a way to bind the event on that instance object or obtain the object before the event is triggered or even after the event is triggered.\n\nAlternatively, I tried to initialize the instance myself and pass that into \"create\", but that simply skips the \"validate\" (or i should validate myself?). It may be related to Issue #1057.\n\nIn the end, I can probably get around with \"set\" or \"save\" to bind the event beforehand.\n"

E.g. `set` passes attributes to be updated to `_validate` method, but inside `_validate` there's the [following code](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js#L491-492):\n\n``` javascript\nattrs = _.extend({}, this.attributes, attrs);\nvar error = this.validate(attrs, options);\n```\n\nthat merges attributes that are about to be updated with all attributes of a model and passes them to `validate`.\n\nBesides, it looks like `model.changed` object that is used e.g. by `model.changedAttributes` is populated after the object is actually validated. Thus during validations, if Backbone passes all attributes to it, I can't easily validate just the attributes that are supposed to be changed.\n"

(Using http://github.com/toddself/Backbone.Validator to perform validation)\n\nExample:\n\n``` javascript\nvar TestModel = Backbone.Model.extend({\n    validators: {\n        title: {\n            min_length: 5,\n            is_type: 'string'\n        }\n    },\n        initialize: function(){\n            this.on('error', this.log);\n        },\n        log: function(model, error){\n            console.log(error);\n        }\n});\n\n// unable to set bad titles\nvar t = new TestModel({title: 'this should work'});\nt.get('title');\n\"this should work\"\n\nt.set('title', false);\n['Expected false to be of type string for title']\n\nt.get('title');\n\"this should work\"\n\n\n// can create when silent: true\nvar t2 = new TestModel({title: false});\nt2.get('title');\nfalse\n\nt2.isValid();\ntrue\n\nt2.set('title', 'this is a good title as well');\nt2.get('title')\n\"this is a good title as well\"\n\nt2.set('title', false);\n['Expected false to be of type string for title']\n\nt2.get('title');\n\"this is a good title as well\"\n\n// but can still create when silent: false\nvar t3 = new TestModel({title: false}, {silent: false});\nt3.get('title');\nfalse\n\nt3.isValid();\ntrue\n\nt3.set('title', 'this is a good title as well');\nt3.get('title')\n\"this is a good title as well\"\n\nt3.set('title', false);\n['Expected false to be of type string for title']\n\nt3.get('title');\n\"this is a good title as well\"\n```\n\nIs this by design?  I see the change logs had forcing validation on new objects for a while, but it was reverted in 0.9.1.  Will we be able to override the hard coded `{silent: true}` or am I just missing something really obvious and I can force validation on create?\n\nAny help is appreciated!\n"

That's not entirely bad, but it could be much simpler if Backbone included a `serialize` method on the model that was called by the default Backbone.sync method.\n\nBasically it would just mean changing this line in Backbone.sync\n `params.data = JSON.stringify(model.toJSON());`\nto this:\n `params.data = JSON.stringify(model.serialize.call(model, model.toJSON()));`\nand then updating the Backbone.Model to include a new no-op `serialize` method just like `parse`:\n\n```\nparse: function(resp, xhr) {\n  return resp;\n},\nserialize: function(attrs) {\n  return attrs;\n},\n```\n"

Put another way, in the add callback on a collection the length was accurate and in sync with the model being added. Does that make sense?\n\nThe code was like:\nfor (var i = 0, l = models.length; i < l; i++) {\n          this._add(models[i], options);\n        }\n\nSo when the add callback say hits a viewer listening for 'add' the length of the collection would increment on each add callback.\n\nNow, the code is more decoupled and the collection is fully populated when add events are triggered.\n\nsplice.apply(this.models, [index, 0].concat(models));\n      if (this.comparator) this.sort({silent: true});\n      if (options.silent) return this;\n      for (i = 0, length = this.models.length; i < length; i++) {\n        if (!cids[(model = this.models[i]).cid]) continue;\n        options.index = i;\n        model.trigger('add', model, this, options);\n      }\n\nThis seems like strange behavior - meaning that add callbacks aren't really callbacks per add but rather a batch after all the models have been added.\n\nThoughts?\n"

This function makes use of decodeURIComponent. \n\nTherefore, after hitting the url:  /search?q=foo%25   \n\n```\nthis.fragment => /search?q=foo%\n```\n\nThe expected page loads fine. Now, hit the url:    /search?q=bar\n\nThe function checkUrl now compares the new url with the old one (this.fragment):\n\n```\nif (current == this.fragment || current == decodeURIComponent(this.fragment)) return false;\n```\n\nNotice \"decodeURIComponent(this.fragment)\"... this is throwing the \"URIError: URI malformed\" error. This is because this.fragment has already been decoded! \n\nI believe that the fix @chexov submitted will resolve this and request that it is pulled onto the main branch.\n"

    "updated_at": "2012-02-08T22:16:13Z",
    "body": "I know there are many issues and forum threads on this issue already, but I just need a little more guidance.  There seem to be a variety of approaches but I keep hitting roadblocks with each one, and I haven't found yet a complete example that uses nested models and collections along with localstorage.\n\nI am trying to create a simple app that has Project models and Task Models.  Each Project can have more than one Task, and there can be more than one Project.  Additionally, I will eventually need Tasks to potentially contain other tasks, but I can leave that aside for now.\n\nIf anyone can provide a full working (simple) example for any of the approaches that are out there it would go a long way at helping newbs like me.  Most approaches, like the example in the FAQ and backbone-relational all rely, at some point, on having a collection embedded in a model in some way, and they set the url on that collection to retrieve the right models.  This doesn't seem to play nicely with localstorage.\n\nAdditionally, the FAQ example does something like this:\n\n``` javascript\nvar Mailbox = Backbone.Model.extend({\n\n  initialize: function() {\n    this.messages = new Messages;\n    this.messages.url = '/mailbox/' + this.id + '/messages';\n    this.messages.on(\"reset\", this.updateCounts);\n  },\n\n  ...\n\n});\n\nvar Inbox = new Mailbox;\n\n// And then, when the Inbox is opened:\n\nInbox.messages.fetch();\n```\n\nSo, instead of setting the collection URL, I initially tried to create a new Store with a custom name like 'taskStore-projectid'.  That mirrors the example where it sets the collection url to something with 'this.id' in it.  First, I had trouble figuring out if I could create the collection store in my model initialize function, or would I need to pass the id to the collection initialize function and have it create the store.  Next, I discovered, that in my model initialize function, 'this.id' is still undefined.  I _think_ this is because in the example, the Mailbox is created with 'var Inbox= new Mailbox', and in my app, the Mailbox equivalent (Project for me) is created from my Mailbox(Project) Collections 'create' function.  \n\nBut I don't know.  I just am too new to backbone to know.  Heck, I don't even know if it will work to create the store that way even if I just gave it a random string.  Plus, I'm not relishing the idea of having a giant list of stores like that, as it seems horribly un-normalized.\n\nThe backbone-relational approach seems good too, but it also hinges on setting a url parameter that is meant to only return the proper models, so I have the same issue there.\n\nThe FAQ goes on to list a few other approaches like:\n- Mirror an SQL database's structure, or the structure of a NoSQL database.\n- Use models with arrays of \"foreign key\" ids, and join to top level collections (a-la tables).\n- For associations that are numerous, use a range of ids instead of an explicit list.\n- Avoid ids, and use direct references, creating a partial object graph representing your data set.\n- Lazily load joined models from the server, or lazily deserialize nested models from JSON documents.\n\nSome of which sound good, and some sound pretty similar to each other, but none of which have some good examples.  I'd love to see some of those bullet points fleshed out.\n\nI guess, ideally, I'd like something that allowed me to use just two stores, one for projects and one for tasks, and a performant way to easily get the tasks for each project, and still be able to leverage collections and all they bring.  \n\nI know I could work around this by setting a project id in each task model, like the 'foreign key' approach above, but is that going to cause any other issues?  Is it backboney enough?\n\nanyway, thanks for letting me vent a bit.  Any help will be appreciated. ;-) \n"

    "body": "Version 0.9.0 introduced a new feature that disallows creating models that do not pass validation.  This seems to limit the ability to use models as dynamic containers of information.  If you have validation rules that specify what a valid model is, it seems the model must now always conform to those rules.  If you can only store valid models, you can't keep invalid information available for redisplay to a user so they can edit or correct it.  If information comes from the server that is invalid, creating the model would just fail.  (I believe this is the case, though have not tested the server scenario.)\n\nWhen the new model is created and it fails validation, there is no way to find out why the model creation failed because an Error is thrown instead of an error event being fired.\n\nThe functionality in 0.5.3 had validate() running only at what seemed logical points in the model's lifecycle.  This was on set() (unless you set the 'silent' flag) and on save().  You were able to more easily manage when validation would run.\n\nThe way Rails handles models is that validation only occurs at certain, specific times, and those can general be overridden.  You can create and empty model for use in a \"new\" form, etc.  I think this is closer to the expectations most folks have for the way models should work.\n\nThe way 0.9.0 works seems limiting.  (I'm sure there are other aspects I'm leaving out, but I wanted to get the discussion rolling.)  Hopefully someone can point out the flaws in my argument, and we can discuss what the validation for models should look like.\n"

    "body": "This is just a proposal for a common situation I am while working in a backbone project. \n\nIt is common for me to access my views' sub-elements many times. Here I put a simple example:\n\n``` javascript\nvar myView = Backbone.View.extend({\n  el: '#myDiv',\n\n  hideButton: function() {\n    this.$('#myButton').hide();\n  },\n\n  showButton: function() {\n    this.$('#myButton').show();    \n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis works fine, but if the button id changes in the future, then I have to change that id in to places in my view (a real project will demand even more changes). So what I always end up doing is something like this:\n\n``` javascript\nvar myView = Backbone.View.extend({\n  el: '#myDiv',\n\n  _initialize_elements: function() {\n     this.elements = {\n        myButton: this.$('#myButton')\n     };\n  },\n\n  initialize: function() {\n    this._initialize_elements();\n  },\n\n  hideButton: function() {\n    this.elements.myButton.hide();\n  },\n\n  showButton: function() {\n    this.elements.myButton.show();    \n  }\n});\n```\n\nFor me this approach is fine, but I don't like to manually initialize every view every single time to store the jQuery reference to each of my view's sub-elements, and also is very easy to forget to do it.\n\nI think the best approach would be for a Backbone view to have an `elements` object that works in a similar way than the `events` object.\n\nE.g.:\n\n``` javascript\nvar myView = Backbone.View.extend({\n  el: '#myDiv',\n\n  elements: {\n    myButton : '#myButton'\n  },\n\n  hideButton: function() {\n    this.elements.myButton.hide();\n  },\n\n  showButton: function() {\n    this.elements.myButton.show();    \n  }\n});\n```\n\nThen, before the `delegateEvents` function is called in Backbone.View constructor, we can replace the value of each `elements` key a jQuery object. I will request for a pull request soon. I would love to hear your comments. \n\n(Please note that this would be useful just in the cases where the HTML elements existed before the view instantiation)\n"

I realize these methods were not part of the \"public\" API of course, but they were quite useful nonetheless.\n\nThese methods exposed functionality that is not otherwise available in Backbone, and were therefore very useful as hook points for extensions (not least of all for me in Backbone-relational). Both of these took a single snippet of data (either a model, or an object that might contain an `id` somewhere... or not) and return the model operated upon. Since both `add` and `remove` simply return the complete collection, they can not be used to determine this, especially when passing in JSON.\n\nI have a sort-of-working workaround for Backbone-relational (using `_.clone(this.models)` before adding, then calling `add`, using `_.difference( this.models, clone )` afterwards and iterating over the diff), but this is quite a performance penalty when compared to the current situation. Especially considering many people use relational  exactly because it automates the handling of a very large amount of models, and this whole process is repeated for every single addition.\n\nAny chance these two could be re-instated?\n"

In the currently available 0.5.3 release on the public Github pages site (documentcloud.github.com/backbone), calling `router.navigate('/search', true)` will match only the route `\"/search\"`. This change causes the only matched route to be `\"search\"` (no leading slash). \n\nI support this being the correct action, but it will break EVERY site's routing that used a leading slash. I discovered this because I was not using pushState and was routing all my paths as `abc.com/#/search` because it gave the path a nice structure with that leading fragment slash.\n###### Issue 2 -- Preventing re-routing to the same fragment\n\nA further complication introduced by this is that Backbone no longer knows if you are trying to route to the same page. Previously, if you tried to route to the same page, the Router would never receive the request. Now, it routes again. \n"

    "updated_at": "2012-01-11T22:03:32Z",
    "body": "Specifically, hacking with `fetch` and removing adding/removing duplicate items to a List causes this problem.\n\nI did something funky and got `.get(id)` to improperly return `undefined` (non-randomly).\n\nHere\u2019s what was going on (steps to reproduce):\n1. Have a Collection (we\u2019ll call it 'List')\n2. Give it a method that does this: \n   - Takes a date range \n   - Calculates if any items in List are within that range, and saves them as `removeLater` \n   - Makes an ajax request for items within that range, by using `fetch` with some extra parameters (importantly, with `{add: true}`, and by passing a query for the range in question)\n   - On `success`, it removes the items in `removeLater` from List. (This prevents duplicates, and gets rid of any items that were deleted on the server, within that range.) Note however that by the time `success` fires, the data has already been parsed and added to the collection (this is why we pre-calculated `removeLater`.)\n   - Also note ranges can overlap, partially or completely or exactly, whatever\n3. Use this method twice, ensuring some overlap. (for testing purposes, consider that there are three groups items can fall into: Only in the first range, only in the second, or in both ranges. I only see the funky behavior in the last case.)\n\nWhat happens?\n\nWell, if you do a `filter()` or `toJSON()`, etc., on our Collection, it will return items (which I do want to be in the Collection!), that have IDs that result in an `undefined` if to `get`!\n\nThis only happens for items that were already in the collection, then removed on `success` of that `fetch` Ajax request.\n\n**So basically, it would seem that if you add an item to a Collection twice, then remove one of it, `get` breaks.** I haven\u2019t tested a general case of this yet, just within my above situation.\n\nAlso, it was fairly straightforward to work around this by using `$.ajax` directly and then `adding` in such a manner such as there are never duplicate objects.\n\n(Note, at first I posted this [as a comment on #708](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/issues/708#issuecomment-3266254).)\n"

    "body": "It would be nice, if just as if you can call .fetch on a collection, or a model, that you may also call .save and .destroy on a collection as well.\n\nCurrently, you may collection.fetch and the server will respond with an array of models. For calling .save() on a collection it can send an array of models to save to the server, Backbone can send an array to POST and a separate array to PUT for models which have an ID. For calling .destroy() on a collection it can send an array of IDs to delete from the system. This would unify the CRUD between model and collection calls, its your choice to perform these operations on the entire collection or an individual model.\n\nTo make it easier on the back end logic, the user could always expect arrays on .save and .destroy operations, so when you save/delete a model, it would send an array with just that model instead of just a single object which needs separate logic because it cannot be iterated over.\n\nCREATE/UPDATE\nmodel.save() ~ POST/PUT /collection\ncollection.save() ~ POST/PUT /collection\nREAD\nmodel.fetch() ~ GET /collection/array_ids\ncollection.fetch() ~ GET /collection/array_ids\nDELETE\nmodel.destroy() ~ DELETE /collection/array_ids\ncollection.destroy() ~ DELETE /collection/array_ids\n\nTherefore, on CREATE/UPDATE (.save) it simply sends an array of objects regardless of if you are saving a model or a collection - if it is a model, then it only sends one object in the array, that particular object, the URL always remains /collection However on READ/DELETE operations, it could send an array of IDs in the URL regardless of if it is a model or collection keeping the back end logic consistent.\n"

Because otherwise the passed models get initialized before the collection itself gets initialized. My specific problem:\n\nI can pass a parent to a collection as an option: \n\n``` CoffeeScript\nparent = new App.Models.Base id: 'parent/123'\nchildren = new App.Collections.Base [{id: 'child/1'},{id: 'child/2'}], parent: parent\n```\n\nIf the parent get's destroyed, the children should get destroyed as well. I could put this logic into `App.Collections.Base` but some models have a parent without belonging to a collection (1:1 relation), so I need to put this logic into `App.Models.Base`.\n\nTo achieve this, I bind the model to its parent's destroy event, in case a parent is present. \n\n``` CoffeeScript\n@parent()?.bind 'destroy', (model, collection, options) =>\n  delete options.success\n  delete options.error\n  @destroy options\n```\n\n`@parent()` method returns `options.parent` from the Model initialization or `options.parent` from Model's Collection initialization.\n\nThe problem is, the collection doesn't have a parent until it is funny initialized, that's why I would like to initialize the passed models after the collection got initialized.\n\nOr is there any reason to keep it the way it is right now?\n"

    "body": "Heyo.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on having a view have an optional wrapper function for it's event handlers. Here's an example that would report any errors unexpected errors in the handler.\n\n```\nvar View = Backbone.View.extend({\n\n   // the event decorator will take the event handler function as the first argument,\n   // and any other arguments as the rest\n   eventDecorator : function () {var func = arguments[0];\n     var args = Array.prototype.slice(arguments, 1);\n      try {\n          f.apply(this, args);\n      } catch (e) {\n          reportError(e);\n     }\n  });\n```\n\nIMO, the main benefit of this would be allowing easy top-level error handling to js tasks kicked off by DOM events (report to server, show an uh-oh message, whatever). This is generally a very sore-spot in Javascript apps because it requires wrapping every callback function manually, so people just don't do it. But since all Backbone events are bound with delegateEvents, we have a nice place to catch them all with a surgical addition. Clearly, this can be accomplished manually, this would just allow cutting out a lot of unneeded boilerplate.\n\nWhat do y'all think?\n"

We also have CategoriesRouter with a route \":categoryId\" that you would access like \"/categories/#1234\". With pushState enabled these would become \"/search/foo\" and \"/categories/1234\".\n\nI initially tried setting the root to \"/search/\" and SearchRouter worked fine, but CategoriesRouter obviously did not.\n\nIt looks like the only other knob I can turn is to make \"search/\" and \"categories/\" part of their respective routes. This is fairly drastic though because it changes the semantics of our fragments and will break existing bookmarks.\n\nWhat's the best solution for this?

    "body": "Although I understand the history behind the Backbone Router, and I am sure there are scenarios where it is desirable to automatically fall back to hash fragment based URLs when there is no HTML5 PushState support, the current implementation is unexpected and inconsistent with how a normal web app is supposed to behave.\n\nI am using Backbone.js to progressively enhance a page. In its current form, everything is 100% functional without any JavaScript. The purpose of the Backbone Router in this is to reroute certain actions to AJAX requests rather than page transitions. I am fine with only targeting modern browsers with PushState support (old browsers will just load the page without AJAX, it's a mobile app anyway). However, there are several hash-based fragment links in the page.\n\nA good example is a link to #top at the bottom of a list of search results. Without Backbone in charge of the browser history, this works fine, but as soon as we turn on the Backbone Router things fall apart in subtle ways. The link to top still works (not triggering a route called \"top\" or \"#top\" in the Router, by the way), and now the \"http://my-path.tld/#top\". If I refresh the page like this, the Router reinterprets this to \"http://my-path.tld/top\" (this time it _does_ trigger a route called \"top\"), which brings the app in an inconsistent state. There is no http://my-path.tld/top/ so if the user refreshes the page, bookmarks this URL or sends it to a friend, it results in a 404 error.\n\nI read the comments on https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/issues/418 as a kind of \"you're holding it wrong\"-response. I do not believe this is the case. If the Backbone Router operates on real URLs, they should be consistent with the way they are supposed to work without JavaScript and as they are now they don't.\n\nThere are probably several solutions to this, but the easiest one would be to allow developers to opt in/out of PushState and hashchange separately and not redirect /#top to /top by default.\n"

    "updated_at": "2014-07-25T21:38:58Z",
    "body": "Problem:\n\nAs the project expands, keeping the source code within one file will become much more problematic. The complexity of the code itself will become an issue without modularizing each part of the framework (Models, Views, Collections, etc...). This easily effects those who wish to use only part and not all of the framework - for example a developer may wish to only use the Models part of the framework and not Views since it may not be necessary.\n\nPossible Solution:\n\nI propose that we modularize each component of the framework, meaning we have one module for Models another for Views and so on. With these we would have different files that follow a convention, something like backbone.models.js and backbone.views.js.\n\nPossible Solution - Pros:\nSome benefits of doing this would be to improve organization, increase modularity and quick referencing. In the long term this will help increase the involvement of the community as it would be easy to find and quickly diagnose issues but it would also allow the community to choose what they need when they need it with custom build processes that could go along with this proposal.\n\nPossible Solution - Cons:\nOn the other hand, it could be a problem as it would probably make it a bit more complex for those who have learned the source code as it is right now. It would also need some more in depth testing of each module and how they relate to each other - tests could become complex with custom build processes as well.\n\nSummary\n\nCurrently the framework exists within one file and is not modular - not giving the community flexibility to easily implement what the need. For this, I propose we modularize the framework. This will allow supporters to use what they want when they want it while giving the framework more structure and organization. I believe the effort to do this would most certainly help community involvement and the overall advancement of the framework.\n"

My page is extremely dynamic, and I load in views which may bind to the same elements. \nI may also create the same view once, create a different view, then recreate the first one. The issue though is the event handlers persist and I will find the event is firing twice.\n\nSo my 'flow' would be viewA --> viewB --> vewA which causes the newest A view to double fire events.\n\nIt feels like for completely dynamic pages, an application would want the ability to completely 'destroy' or 'unbindAllEvents' for a given view, which I cant seem to figure out. Is there a known solution for this? If not, is it something others feel is needed? I could code it and provide a pull request if others want.\n\nOne other note - a view can have multiple views in it, so you would expect it to unbind all subviews as well.\n\nThanks\n"

One for the current item, one for the upcoming items and one hidden for buffering some images, all of them has only 5-10 models. The thing that i want to do is to get the first element from a collection (this) to pass it to another collection. \n\n``` javascript\nvar Items = Backbone.Collection.extend({\n    model: Item,\n    getItem: function() {\n        // returns and removes the first item from this collection\n        if (this.length) {\n            var firstItemId = this.toJSON()[0].id;\n            itemToReturn = this.get(firstItemId);\n            this.remove(itemToReturn);\n            return itemToReturn;\n        } else {\n            qbConsole.log('No more items in '+this.name+'.');\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n});\n```\n\nIn the code above, itemToReturn is sometimes randomly undefined, even the Collection has the model with the specified ID, that is the only model with this ID, and ID is integer in the model.\n\nBtw it seems Backbone.Collection.at(index) works properly on the same codebase, here is my working code. I figured out that this is the proper way to solve my problem, but hopefully this issue helps you guys make Backbone.js more better.\n\n``` javascript\nvar Items = Backbone.Collection.extend({\n    model: Item,\n    getItem: function() {\n        // returns and removes the first item from this collection\n        if (this.length) {\n            itemToReturn = this.at(0);\n            this.remove(itemToReturn);\n            return itemToReturn;\n        } else {\n            qbConsole.log('No more items in '+this.name+'.');\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n});\n```\n\nBest,\nmilan\n"

By default this is false and the behavior would continue to throw an error. If set to true, then the Backbone.sync would just run the success callback and not attempt to contact the server if no URL is defined. If a URL is defined for an object, then it would behave normally.\n"

Yay.\n\nThe same is not true for a collection. It has the same API: pass it a model and options. But backbone only uses that options for setting the comparator on the collection `if (options.comparator) this.comparator = options.comparator;` and does not pass the options along to the collection's `initialize()` function. \n\nSeems like for the sake of consistency it should pass along the options.\n\nMy use case is I have a nested collection, and I want to pass in as an option the parent model so that the nested collection's initialize() has access to it, and can pass along the reference to it's models. Contrived (and silly) example: A farmer (model) has some turkeys (collection), and I want the turkeys to know which farmer they belong to so they can plot against him before Thanksgiving.  \n"

    "body": "This is a proposal...\n\nProblem:\nWhen multiple objects (e.g. views) bind to the same event on a model and pass in the same callback, unbind is not reliable because it will unbind the first callback that matches the event name / callback combination in the _callbacks array.  For example:\n\nvar MyView = Backbone.View.extend({\n  initialize: function() {\n    this.model.bind('change', this.render, this);\n  },\n\n  unbindChange: function(){\n     this.model.unbind('change', this.render); \n  }\n});\n\nvar view1 = new MyView({model: model123});\nvar view2= new MyView({model: model123});\n\nview2.unbindChange(); // Oh oh!  I just unbound view1's callback and not view2's.\n\nPossible solution is to allow an optional 3rd argument, the context, to unbind. This way, if the context is passed, unbind will make sure the context matches before it unbinds.  If a context is not passed, the behavior will be the same as before, so this is fully backwards compatible:\n\n```\n    unbind: function (ev, callback, context) {\n        var calls;\n        if (!ev) {\n            this._callbacks = {};\n        } else if (calls = this._callbacks) {\n            if (!callback) {\n                calls[ev] = [];\n            } else {\n                var list = calls[ev];\n                if (!list) return this;\n                for (var i = 0, l = list.length; i < l; i++) {\n                    if (list[i] && callback === list[i][0] && (!context || list[i][1] === context)) {\n                        list[i] = null;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return this;\n    }\n```\n"

    "body": "First of all, backbone.js is great.  You deserve much credit for making something so useful!\n\nI believe there is a minor issue with the way the `initialize` is now called.  Consider for a moment that someone might add an aspect (e.g. `_.wrap`) to their model's `set` method (or simply override it) as I have.  I would think it safe to say that inside all methods other than `initialize` we should be able to assume that initialization has already occurred; however, the Model constructor actually calls `set` before it calls `initialize`.\n\nIn my instance, since I am using documents (models with embedded models--think MongoDB), it is important that I have a reference to the parent document.  I accomplish this by passing a `parent` property in the options;  The problem is that I can't attach that `parent` property to the model until I get to the `initialize` method.  As my enhanced `set` method relies upon having access to the parent, this doesn't work cleanly.  I've had to do something like this:\n\n```\noccurrence: function(data, fn){ //this is method creates an embedded document\n  var payload = data, data = _.extract(data, 'id'); //pulls id into its own object\n  var o = new Occurrence(data, {parent: this}); //pass only the id attribute here\n  o.set(payload); //pass the rest of the attributes here after the parent is attached\n  Occurrence.collection.add(o);\n  fn && fn.apply(o);\n  return o;\n}\n```\n\nAlternately, I've experimented with adding a `preinitialize` hook that is called before any other methods are called.  This works, but I don't like modifying vendor libraries.\n\n```\nBackbone.Model = function(attributes, options) {\n  var defaults;\n  attributes || (attributes = {});\n  if (defaults = this.defaults) {\n    if (_.isFunction(defaults)) defaults = defaults();\n    attributes = _.extend({}, defaults, attributes);\n  }\n  this.attributes = {};\n  this._escapedAttributes = {};\n  this.cid = _.uniqueId('c');\n  this.preinitialize && this.preinitialize(attributes, options); //a new hook\n  this.set(attributes, {silent : true});\n  this._changed = false;\n  this._previousAttributes = _.clone(this.attributes);\n  if (options && options.collection) this.collection = options.collection;\n  this.initialize(attributes, options);\n};\n```\n\nAny thoughts on this?  Both approaches work, but the first seems awkward and second required me to touch backbone source.\n"

    "body": "One of the things I'm finding myself doing is using a generic global event object, something like:\n\n```\nvar BackboneExt = BackboneExt || {Dispatcher: _.extend({}, Backbone.Events)};\n```\n\nThis allows me to build a model like:\n\n```\nPerson = Backbone.Model.extend({\n    initialize: function (){\n        this.bind(\"change\", function (model){\n            BackboneExt.Dispatcher.trigger(\"Person:change\", model);\n        })\n    }\n});\n```\n\nNow I have the ability to hook into this generic event anywhere in my code by doing:\n\n```\nBackboneExt.Dispatcher.bind(\"Person:change\", function(model){\n    console.log('Backbone.Dispatcher');\n    console.dir(model);\n});\n```\n\nThis allows me to hook into the Model in many places of my code (view, controllers, etc) without passing down dependencies. I'd really love to shorten that further to something like:\n\n```\nPerson = Backbone.Model.extend({\n    initialize: function (){\n        // the below line would bind a \"change\" event, then trigger the global dispatcher object (like the commented code below)\n        this.dispatch(\"Person\", \"change\");\n/*\n        this.bind(\"change\", function (model){\n            BackboneExt.Dispatcher.trigger(\"Person:change\", model);\n        })\n    }\n*/\n});\n```\n\nI've love to see something like this baked into Backbone.\n"

The value of attribute 'b' will change.\n4. An event 'change:b' will be triggered from the model.\n5. The value of attribute 'c' will change.\n6. An event 'change:c' will be triggered from the model.\n\nEvents 'change:a' and 'change:b' leave the model in an inconsistent state, as not all the attributes have been changed yet, and so the model is in an \"in-between\" state of the previous and the new states.\n\nAssume further you have bound a function accessModel to the event 'change:a' on the model, and that accessModel needs to access the attribute 'c' of the model. In this case, by the time accessModel is called, after event 'change:a' has been triggered, the attribute 'a' will have changed, but the attribute 'c' will not yet have changed.

Otherwise you have to introduce your own events or some random fields which you set to make sure that a change event is emitted.\n\nIn my case I was implementing tabs with backbone, and I wanted the user to be able to click on an already selected tab.  And the whole thing broke down because backbone started comparing the value with the existing value and not sending the change events.\n\nThis reminds me of mysql which also doesn't return information that it updated a row if the value you set on it was the same than before.  This way you can't figure out if there was a row matching your query at all and have to do a select and then update or insert, instead of update and then insert if it was not there.\n\nLet me know what you think.\n"

A constructor function called by itself (without new) should never return a value. But even if users avoid return values from their own constructors, I can think of at least one bug this might cause, or at least one nice feature this would allow if the above code were changed to avoid a return value.\n\nFor example, to leverage inheritance in Backbone, currently I must extend Backbone.Model (or Collection, View, etc.). However, what if I just wanted to define a minimal set of classes that extend Object. I might try this:\n\n```\n// let anything to be extended\nObject.extend = Backbone.Model.extend;\n\n// namespace\nvar Acme = {};\n\n// define classes\nAcme.Person = Object.extend();\nAcme.Warrior = Acme.Person.extend();\nAcme.Ninja = Acme.Warrior.extend();\n\n// instantiate\nvar mary = new Acme.Person();\nvar will = new Acme.Warrior();\nvar john = new Acme.Ninja();\n\n// unit tests\nok(mary instanceof Object && mary instanceof Acme.Person && mary.constructor === Acme.Person);\nok(will instanceof Object && will instanceof Acme.Person && will instanceof Acme.Warrior && will.constructor === Acme.Warrior);\nok(john instanceof Object && john instanceof Acme.Person && john instanceof Acme.Warrior && john instanceof Acme.Ninja && john.constructor === Acme.Ninja);\n```\n\nThe unit tests fail when the return statement is used. However, if you remove the return from your parent constructor call, then all tests will pass.\n\nIn other words, if this change is made, then we can also use Backbone to define simple class inheritance without using Backbone-specific classes.\n"

So I propose this little change to the make method: \n\n``` javascript\n\nmake : function(tagName, attributes, content) \n    {\n         # addition\n     if ('undefined' != typeof this.id)\n     {\n         var eElem = $('#' + this.id);\n         if ( eElem.length > 0 ) return eElem;\n     }\n         # end of addition\n\n\n     var el = document.createElement(tagName);\n     if (attributes) $(el).attr(attributes);\n     if (content) $(el).html(content);\n     return el;\n     }\n```\n"

This presents 2 problems:\n- Your `<li>` is wrapped in a div (producing invalid markup) or another unneeded element\n- Your events are more verbose: `'click .asset' : 'select'` instead of just `'click' : 'select'`\n\nOne solution would be to exclude the `<li>` from the template, and have Backbone construct it with the `el`, `className`, etc. properties. But a big benefit of using templates is that they are not mixed with the view logic, and that you can write them just like normal HTML.\n### Solution(s)\n\nMy suggestion would be a new `template` property:\n\n```\nApp.Views.Asset = Backbone.View.extend({\n\n  events: {\n    'click' : 'select'\n  },\n\n  template: _.template($(\"asset-template\").html()),\n\n    ...\n\n}\n```\n\nIf `template` is present, it's presumed the template is fully-formed and no wrapper elements are created.\n\nAnother option would be the ability to assign the template directly to `this.el`, while keeping the event delegation working:\n\n```\n// this currently works, but you lose event delegation\nthis.el = _.template( $(\"#asset-template\").html(), data);\n```\n\nCould be I'm missing something and it's possible to achieve 'unwrapped templates' now, but after using Backbone for a couple of projects I kept stumbling on this.\n"

One problem with the current way Backbone does things is that you have to do something like this to handle things (pseudocode):\n\nMy view class:\n\ninitialize: function(){\n   this.changeListener_ = this.render.bind(this);\n   this.model.bind('change:revision', this.changeListener_);\n},\n\nrender: function(){\n  // ...\n},\n\nremove: function(){\n   this.model.unbind('change:revision', this.changeListener_);\n}\n\n---\n\nMost of the time you want to bind your Backbone listeners to an instance. However, in order to safely unbind them you have to keep an instance variable around for them to truly unbind them. This gets gross and leads to code clutter.\n\nIf the bind and unbind methods allowed an optional instance variable as their third argument, this goes away and the code becomes much cleaner (pseudocode):\n\nMy view class:\n\ninitialize: function(){\n   this.model.bind('change:revision', this.render, this);\n},\n\nrender: function(){\n  // ...\n},\n\nremove: function(){\n   this.model.unbind('change:revision', this.render, this);\n}\n\n---\n\nNow there is enough context to unbind 'change:revision' for this.render bound to the 'this' variable. When Backbone makes the call it can simply do an apply and pass in the optional third argument.\n"

    "body": "I've started to build a widget using backbone that can be easily dropped into any webpage. Someone might want to include multiple instances of this widget on the same page. Or I might create additional widgets and need to include more than one on a page. This widget allows cross-domain retrieval of data to be displayed on an external site.\n\nThis widget is actually a mini-app and needs to be able to display different views based on actions a user takes. I'm using a backbone router/controller to display the right view. The selected view needs to be bookmarkable and browser back/forward buttons should navigated through user interactions.\n\nBut what if multiple mini-apps are embedded on a single page? Is this possible using backbone's routers? How would having multiple routers work? Can a router listen to just part of the hash string?\n\nSo you can better understand the use case, imagine a sports league that wants to display schedules and standings. A widget can be included onto their webpage that displays a list of divisions. Clicking a division displays a list of teams and a game schedule for the division. Clicking on a team displays the schedule just for that team. A team might want to send a link out to their users of their own schedule, so each team's schedule needs to be bookmarkable.\n\nThis works fine if there is only one \"schedule widget\" on the page. But what if the league wants to include two instances of this widget? Perhaps they have a widget displaying the \"current season\" and another one displaying \"last season\" so that people can go and view the standings and results.\n\nLastly, how about interacting with non-backbone hash-string interactions on the page? I'm assuming there really isn't anything I could do if something on the page has a link like `<a href=\"#top\">Back to top</a>`.\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated!\n"

Thanks!\n\nUPDATED\n\nI updated the code to help illustrate that I am not moving the tag between collections, but rather adding a reference to the tag to a second collection. Then, when I remove the tag from the second collection (not the first), Backbone cannot resolve the first collection, and then cannot get the url for saving.\n\nI am confused as to why removing the tag from one collection would have an impact on the reference to that tag in a separate collection.\n\nI am coming from a C# background. Maybe objects and collections work differently here.\n"

Tedious to maintain - with a large class, you get a massive list of these bindings\n3. `_.bindAll(this)` doesn't work as the (underscore) documentation would lead one to believe\n4. Counterintuitive - just going `this.model.bind('remove', this.remove);` in the `initialize` of a view doesn't do what's expected (additionally, due to how jQuery works, it won't generate an error either)\n5. Some methods DO have automatic binding of `this` (for example the methods named in the events-hash)\n\nAre there technical reasons preventing automatic binding of all methods from working?

In the following line, repeated several times in Backbone when this.sync is called:\n\n(this.sync || Backbone.sync)('read', this, success, error);\n\nThe left parentheses evaluates first, generating a function pointer unbound to an instance. We then call ('read', this, success, error) on the function pointer. However, at this point the function is not bound to an instance, so it gains the default global 'this' of DOMWindow.\n\nThe fix to this is simple. Replace the || magic with something like the following:\n\nif (this.sync) this.sync('read', this, success, error);\nelse Backbone.sync('read', this, success, error);\n\nNote that this is an important bug, since it can lead to lots of hard to track down Backbone bugs where 'this' isn't bound correctly in your instance sync method.\n"

That means multiple instances of a Backbone model will have shared attributes; which leads to crazy-town.\n\njQuery's extend does a better job of deeply cloning. The other solution I've found locally is to simply define the defaults to be a function that returns a new anonymous object rather than assigning the anonymous object to the defaults property of the model class.\n\nI'm not sure what (if anything) Backbone should do about this.

    "body": "I've developed a nice rich application interface where users can add objects very quickly, and then start updating properties of those objects by simply tabbing to the relevant fields.  The problem I am having is that sometimes the user beats the server to it's initial save and we end up saving two objects.  \n\nAn example of how to recreate this problem is as follows:\n1. User clicks the Add person button, we add this to the DOM but don't save anything yet as we don't have any data yet.\ncode sample --> person = new Person();\n2. User enters a value into the Name field, and tabs out of it (name field loses focus).  This triggers a save so that we update the model on the server.  As the model is new, Backbone.js will automatically issue a POST (create) request to the server.\ncode sample --> person.set ({ name: 'John' });\ncode sample --> person.save(); // create new model\n3. User then very quickly types into the age field they have tabbed into, enters 20 and tabs to the next field (age therefore loses focus).  This again triggers a save so that we update the model on the server.\ncode sample --> person.set ({ age: 20 });\ncode sample --> person.save(); // update the model\n\nSo we would expect in this scenario one POST request to create the model, and one PUT requests to update the model.\n\nHowever, if the first request is still being processed and we have not had a response before the code in point 3 above has run, then what we actually get is two POST requests and thus two objects created instead of one.\n\nSo my question is whether there is some best practice way of dealing with this problem and Backbone.js?  Or, should Backbone.js have a queuing system for save actions so that one request is not sent until the previous request on that object has succeeded/failed?  Or, alternatively should I build something to handle this gracefully by either sending only one create request instead of multiple update requests, perhaps use throttling of some sort, or check if the Backbone model is in the middle of a request and wait until that request is completed.\n\nYour advice on how to deal with this issue would be appreciated.\n\nAnd I'm happy to take a stab at implementing some sort of queuing system, although you may need to put up with my code which just won't be as well formed as the existing code base!\n"

However, at the moment I cannot, because the collection of selected items will \"own\" the items added to it. This effectively destroys the syncing inside of the original collection. Of course, I can use a plain array, but then I do not have access to events. I could also extend Backbone.Events, but why should I have to do this when I just want a more simple collection?\n\nI suggest Backbone.Collection to be divided into a very plain base class (underscore functions, triggering etc.) and build the syncing functionality on top of it by extending. This should not break any existing functionality if done correctly.\n"

    "body": "I've found that there are some common things I often need to do to attributes that are entered by a user before saving them to a Model. For instance, if an attribute is a string, I trim() whitespace around it.\n\nCurrently, I'm doing this before calling model.set(). But doing so adds clutter to my view code. So I've thought about creating a BaseModel that overrides set(). This would obviously work, but it means that my BaseModel.set() will loop through all attributes being set, and then Model.set() will loop through them again.\n\nIt occurs to me that Backbone models could quite easily preprocess values before setting an attribute. A preprocessor function could be added to the model or to the options passed to set().  So for instance:\n\n```\nvar UserModel = Backbone.Model.extend({\n  preprocessAttribute: function(attr) {\n    return _.isString(attr) ? $.trim(attr) : attr;\n  }\n});\n```\n\nAlternatively, the preprocess function could be passed in the options to set():\n\n```\nuser.set({name: \"   nameWithWhitespace   \"},{preprocessAttribute: function(attr) {return attr;}});\n```\n\nThis could be accomplished with very little change to backbone.js. A simple change to line 211 (as of 4/18/2011) is all that it would take:  \nhttps://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js#L211\n\n```\nset : function(attrs, options) {\n\n  // ...\n\n      // Line 211 currently is: \n      // now[attr] = val;\n\n      // Change line 211 to:\n      now[attr] = options.preprocessAttribute ? options.preprocessAttribute(val) : \n        (this.preprocessAttribute ? this.preprocessAttribute(val) : val);\n\n  // ...\n\n},\n```\n\nThe function name `preprocessAttribute` is a bit long and cumbersome, so some other name might be better. I'm sure there are many more uses for this than just trimming whitespace. \n"

    "body": "Hi\n\nI stuck on one problem since 2 days and I can't find any nice solution.\n\nMy view is listening to click event on a button. If user makes a click, the view changes location.hash AND adds a class name to the button, which was clicked, selecting it using currentTarget of passed event object. Controller is listening to the hashchange and says to the model to fetch some data. The view is listening to change event of the model and renders the view then.\n\nThis works fine so far.\n\nThe same but triggered by browser:\n\nMy controller gets a hashchange event, caused by user using adress bar. Controller says to the model to fetch some data from the server. The view is listening to change event of the model and renders the html. \n\nBut I need to add the class name to the button to make it active. So the only way right now is to select the element manually and to add the class.\n\nhere example code:\n\n```\nvar View = Backbone.View.extend({\n    events: {\n        'click .action': 'action'\n    },\n\n    initialize: function() {\n        var self = this;\n        this.model.bind('change:view', function() {\n            this.action();\n        });\n    },\n\n    action: function(e) {\n        location.hash = '/action/done'; \n\n        this.$(e ? e.currentTarget : '.action').addClass('active');\n    }\n})\n```\n\nwhat I am looking for is a way to make this interaction between controller and view events more automatically. F.e. a method which will enable me to trigger click event on the .action  button probably without to write the code for triggering or selecting the element.\n\nYou know what I mean? Am I doing something totally wrong or missundestand any concepts?\n\nf.e. something like this:\n\n```\nvar View = Backbone.View.extend({\n    events: {\n        'click .action': 'action'\n    },\n\n    initialize: function() {\n        var self = this;\n        // triggerHandler method will trigger the proper event on proper element using its handler name\n        this.model.bind('change:view', function() {\n            self.triggerHandler('action');\n        });\n    },\n\n    // this function will be executed twice, this have to be prevented\n    action: function(e) {\n        location.hash = '/action/done'; \n        // because triggerHandler will trigger the event, event object is always passed and\n        // there is no need to use selector here\n        this.$(e.currentTarget).addClass('active');\n    }\n})\n```\n"

Thought I might do this by simply unbinding the callback within itself.  The problem with that is if there are multiple events bound for example to a model's change event, the trigger for the subsequent event errors out.  This is because callbacks are kept within an array, trigger loops through the array of callbacks, but if one of those callbacks removes itself (unbind), the slice of the callback changes the array size and then within the trigger loop it tries to call a callback on the array which doesn't exist anymore.\n\nSo, two questions.  Has anyone else has to deal with a situation where a callback should only be triggered once? If so, how did you accomplish it?\n\nAlso, it seems like there could be a better way to keep track of callbacks in events than to store them in an array and using slice to remove them, which could guard against a callback removing itself from the list and still allow others to continue.\n\n```\ntrigger : function(ev) {\n  var list, calls, i, l;\n  if (!(calls = this._callbacks)) return this;\n  if (list = calls[ev]) {\n    for (i = 0, l = list.length; i < l; i++) {\n      // if the callback unbinds itself then the list length changes and the\n      // following events will not be called in the correct order or at all.\n      list[i].apply(this, Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1));\n    }\n  }\n  if (list = calls['all']) {\n    for (i = 0, l = list.length; i < l; i++) {\n      list[i].apply(this, arguments);\n    }\n  }\n  return this;\n}\n```\n"

Basically, when a PUT or DELETE is called, the tag is set to the version of the record on the client and that is then matched to the server to make sure that the record did not change since the client retrieved it.  If it does, then a 412 status code is supposed to be sent.  While not quite a standard, this is an accepted way of handling optimistic concurrency in REST services.  \n\nPUTs can obviously just pass the correct version in the body of the request.  Put a DELETE request can not.  The IF-Match alleviates the problem.\n\nIf this is something to pursue, I have absolutely no idea about the best way of handling it.  I created a fix that was very specific to our needs.  In the Backbone.synch, I simply added the following code to match up a version attribute on the model:\n\n```\n    var version = model.get(\"version\");\n    if (!isNullOrUndefined(version))\n        params.beforeSend = function (xhr) {\n            xhr.setRequestHeader(\"If-Match\", version);\n        };\n```\n"

If you'll remove `dataType: \"json\"` from the ajax params, it works nicely ([line 975](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js#L975)), which is weird. \n\nDo we have to use `encodeURIComponent` on attribute values?

    "created_at": "2011-02-17T10:41:10Z",
    "updated_at": "2011-05-27T18:55:41Z",
    "body": "Error handling could do with some improvement in backbone. The arguments passed to the error callback are not consistent. It makes it difficult to determine inside of the error handler what caused the error. There is also additional information that is not passed the the user's error and success handlers that would be useful. \n\n---\n\nSorry for the long posting, but I've done a lot of valuable debugging and wanted to get it all into writing so that it isn't lost. I also want to describe some scenarios in detail:\n\n1: When model.save() is called, set() is run on the attributes passed to it. Set() then calls validate(). If validate() fails, it returns an error object to set(), which calls the options.error() with the model and the error object, or triggers an error event with the model, the error object, and save's options object. So in this scenario, two different error handler signatures are used.\n\n```\nError event handler gets:\n    *model*\n    *validation error*\n    *original save options*\nError callback gets:\n    *model*\n    *validation error*\n```\n\n2: If initial validation succeeds in model.save(), then wrapper error and success handlers are assigned to the original options.error and options.success. These wrappers call the original options.error and options.success if they existed. The error wrapper triggers an error event if options.error did not exist. So assuming sync() fails, the error wrapper is called which either calls the original save options.error method or triggers an error event.\n\nHowever, the error wrapper only has one parameter even though jQuery's ajax error callback receives three arguments (jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown). Only jqXHR is passed on to the error wrapper, which then passes the model, jqXHR, and the \"enhanced\" save options back to the backbone user's error handler. It would be nice if textStatus and errorThrown was also provided to the user's error handler.\n\nAlso note that the options passed to the error handler has options.error and options.success overwritten with wrapper methods for the original method. So if you use those in your callback for some reason, more than what you expect might happen (wrapped success calls model.set() and wrapped error could trigger an error event).\n\n```\nError event handler gets\n    *model*\n    *jqXHR object*\n    *save options with wrapped handlers*\nError callback gets:\n    *model*\n    *jqXHR object*\n    *save options with wrapped handlers*\n```\n\n3: If initial validation succeeds in model.save(), and sync() is successful, then the wrapped success handler is called. This takes the new data returned from the server and calls model.set() with it. The set() method in turn calls validate(). If validate() fails, then set() fails, which then causes options.error to be called or an error event to be triggered.\n\nUnfortunately, the jqXHR object which has been provided to the wrapped success handler does not get passed on to model.set(). So when model.validate() fails, it doesn't know about the jqXHR object and cannot pass it to the error handler. Of course, at this point, it is calling the _wrapped_ error handler, not the original error handler. This could pose problems if more logic is added to the wrapped error handler in the future.\n\n```\nError event handler gets:\n    *model*\n    *validation error object from XHR resulting data*\n    *save options with wrapped handlers*\nError callback gets:\n    *model*\n    *validation error object from XHR resulting data*\n```\n\n---\n\nAs you can see, the objects passed to the error handlers in these 3 scenarios are all different. This makes it very difficult to write error handlers that do what you want.\n\nFirst and foremost, I believe that all error callbacks should receive the same and consistent arguments. When certain arguments aren't available, null values would be passed.\n\nHowever, since there are many possible arguments that might be available, I'd suggest combining them into a single object. Perhaps something like this, although it certainly might be overkill:\n\n```\n{\n    model: (original model),\n    validation: {\n        beforeSync: (result of first validate() call),\n        afterSync: (result of second validate() call)\n    },\n    data: (plain JS object of JSON.parse(jqXHR.responseText) ),\n    response: (jquery jqXHR object),\n    textStatus: (passed to jquery error handler),\n    errorThrown: (passed to jquery error handler),\n    options: {\n        original: (original options passed to save() call),\n        wrapped: (options with wrapped error and success)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\nAnother option jashkenas and I discussed on #documentcloud is to have multiple error handlers. There could be validationError and syncError methods passed in the options to save(). In addition, there could be sync:error and validate:error events triggered. \n\nThis approach may complicate things too much, but then again it might be simpler than passing that massive object above to an error handler and expecting the user to write code to handle every situation.\n\n---\n\nLastly, it would be good to also make sure that success() arguments are consistent and have all of the information a user might need.  For instance, in Model.save(), the following wrapped success method is created:\n\n```\n  options.success = function(resp) {\n    if (!model.set(model.parse(resp), options)) return false;\n    if (success) success(model, resp);\n  };\n```\n\nHowever, when jquery calls this method as the success handler for $.ajax(), it passes three arguments. It would be useful to pass those objects to the user's onSuccess handler. Even better if there is a way to also pass them to model.set() so that if model.validate() fails, they can be passed to the error handler.\n\n```\n  options.success = function(resp,textStatus,jqXHR) {\n    if (!model.set(model.parse(resp), options)) return false;\n    if (success) success(model, resp, textStatus, jqXHR);\n  };\n```\n\nI think that's everything that I've discovered when dealing with error callbacks. Sorry to write a novel, but hopefully it will be useful.\n\nTauren\n"

    "body": "I'd like to add a server-side step to my model validation, but I see no way for this to be possible. A model is validated based on the return value of validate. If there is a return value, validation fails, if there is no return value, it succeeds. There isn't an asynchronous, non-blocking way to delay the return of validate() until an XHR request has completed.\n\nFor instance, assume my account sign-up form gives live feedback if a username is available or not. As you type a username, the UI is updated to show the username field as valid or invalid. An onblur handler would set the new value on the model whenever the username is changed. The model.validate() would do some local sanity checks and then validate the username with the server via an XHR request. Here's a non-working example:\nhttp://pastebin.com/pDA1vajp\n\nTo do this, validate() would need to provide a callback before any sort of XHR step could be part of the validation. Perhaps something like this:\n\n```\nvalidate: function(attrs,callback) {\n  if(attrs.username && !attrs.username.match(/^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]{2,25}$/i)) {\n    callback(\"Invalid Username\");\n  }\n  else {\n    var jqxhr = $.get(\"/api/members/check/\"+encodeURIComponent(attrs.username))\n      .success(function() {\n         // Username is available, validate should succeed\n         // meaning it should return nothing\n         callback();\n      })\n      .error(function() {\n         // Username is not available, validate should fail\n         // meaning it should return anything\n         callback(\"Username Exists\");\n      });\n  }\n```\n\nThe callback would be given the return value. If no value should be returned (validation succeeded), then no parameters would be passed: callback().\n\nObviously, this might mean significant changes to Model._performValidation(), as it's logic would need to support getting the validation response via a callback. It might also affect other places in the codebase, such as set() and save().\n\nWouldn't this be a valuable feature? Or is there a better way to accomplish what I'm after?\n"

This will facilitate UI feedback to indicate AJAX events are happening.\n\nSecondly is a way of storing a hash inside models/collections which is translated to URL attributes when making a fetch on the server.

E.g:\n\ncollection.setURLAttributes({\n    per_page: \"5\",\n    page: \"2\"\n});\n\nThis set would then be translated into:\n\nhttp://localhost?per_page=5&page=2\n\nsetURLAttributes could also have a callback event associated with it.\n\nSam\n"

Though that's not what it seems to be happening.\n\nI've set up a [modified version of the example app](https://github.com/juliocesar/backbone-test-todo) that doesn't set a default content for todo, and requires that field not to be empty through `validate()`. Submitting an empty item now doesn't do anything view-wise (expected), but upon refreshing the page, one can see it still adds empty entries anyway.\n\nI tried the same thing without localStorage to make sure the problem isn't in the adapter, and I can confirm it's reproducible even with an actual backend taking and responding to requests (POSTs still go through for invalid records).\n\nSo my question is: how do I actually prevent `save()` from happening with validations?\n\nThanks!\n"

I mean, I guess that fetching `/projects/1/tickets` and `/users/1/tickets` into 2 collections may have some shared Ticket models and ideally there would only be one Ticket model instance with `ID=123` in memory so that a single update to it would be reflected in all views.\n\nI guess it can be solved in many ways, just wondering if we're thinking about it the right way.\n\nThanks!\n"

    "updated_at": "2011-05-27T17:56:41Z",
    "body": "I've read the docs, FAQ, and most of the around 190 issues and understand that models can contain collections and other models. Questions related to this are common, and I think it may be because more complex scenarios are not explained anywhere. I'd like to present a specific use case that I haven't seen solved yet and gain some insight into ways to solve it.\n\nNote that the simple example in the FAQ makes complete sense, but I'm still unclear on how to best handle nested models and collections when multiple collections need references to the SAME nested models. Here's some JSON to illustrate better:\n\n```\nvar projects = [\n  {\n    id: 1, \n    name: \"ProjectA\", \n    members: [\n      {id: 1, name: \"Tom\", phone: \"555-5555\"},\n      {id: 2, name: \"Sue\", phone: \"555-4444\"}\n    ], \n    manager: {id: 1, name: \"Tom\", phone: \"555-5555\"}\n  },\n  {\n    id: 2, \n    name: \"ProjectB\", \n    members: [\n      {id: 2, name: \"Sue\", phone: \"555-4444\"},\n      {id: 3, name: \"Kim\", phone: \"555-3333\"}\n    ], \n    manager: {id: 2, name: \"Sue\", phone: \"555-4444\"}\n  }\n];\n```\n\nNotice that both project A and B have some of the same members, and the manager of each project can also be a member of that project as well as other projects. Besides the fact I'm sending the same redundant user information multiple times, the problem with this is that the Sue model in Project A is a _different_ model than Sue in Project B. If her phone number is changed in one model, how would views of the other model get updated?\n\nSo rather than sending the same redundant user information multiple times, I thought it would be better to simply pass _references_. So now the JSON would look like this:\n\n```\nvar users = [\n  {id: 1, name: \"Tom\", phone: \"555-5555\"},\n  {id: 2, name: \"Sue\", phone: \"555-4444\"},\n  {id: 3, name: \"Kim\", phone: \"555-3333\"}\n];\n\nvar projects = [\n  {id: 1, name: \"ProjectA\", members: [1,2], manager: 1},\n  {id: 2, name: \"ProjectB\", members: [2,3], manager: 2},\n];\n```\n\nNotice in projects that members is a collection that contains _references_ to users and manager is a reference to a single user. But now I need to start managing a global repository of user models in order to have a place too lookup these user IDs. With a global user repository, I would use code like this to wire it up:\n\n```\nvar Project = Backbone.Model.extend({\n  initialize: function(attr) {\n    this.members = new UserCollection;\n    _.each(attr.members,function(){\n      var user = APP.users.get(this); // locate user in global repository\n      if (!user) user = new User({id: this}); // create empty user with this id\n      this.members.add(user);\n    });\n    this.manager = APP.users.get(attr.manager);\n    if (!this.manager) this.manager = new User({id: attr.manager);\n    this.members.bind(\"refresh\", this.updateMembers);\n    this.manager.bind(\"change\", this.updateManager);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nSo here's my questions.\n1. Is this a good way to do this, or is there a better pattern I should be using?\n2. Where is the best place for this global repository of users? I'd like my APP object to be my Controller, but my controller loads the users and projects in it's initialize function, so the variable APP doesn't exist yet when my projects are initialized. I'm finding I have to load my users separately so that when I load projects I can access APP.users.\n3. Would it be better to pass a reference of my APP through each collection and model in the tree? My Controller APP object would create a Project collection and include {APP: this} in it. But what if I have several levels in the JSON hierarchy, then I'd have to pass the APP to the collection, to each model it creates, to each collection in each of those models, and so forth.\n4. Since all use of users would do a lookup from APP.users, fetching/creating users would need to keep adding to the global repository. Some way to manage references would need to be created so that the repository could purge models that are no longer used anywhere. This means that a standard Backbone.Collection probably wouldn't work for this user repository, and that a Repository object would be needed.\n\nPerhaps I'm over-complicating things, and in fact I hope I am! But it really seems like global model repositories would simplify more complex scenarios with nested models and model references. Is there a better solution, or would a Repository object be the best way to go? Would Backbone be interested in a Repository implementation and contribution?\n"

    "body": "Since `options` started to get passed by `trigger`, I fell into situations where `success/error` callbacks got called multiple times. Consider this case of cascading model fetches:\n    model.bind('change', function(options) {\n        anotherModel.fetch(options);\n    });\n    model.fetch({\n      success: function() {\n        console.log('Fetch model success!');\n      },\n      error: function() {\n        console.log('Fetch model Error.');\n      }\n    );\nBoth `model` and `anotherModel` will trigger the same success callback whereas only `model` should. The solution I implemented was to remove the `success` and `error` properties on the `options` object inside `fetch`:\n    fetch : function(options) {\n      options || (options = {});\n      var onsuccess = options.success; if (options.success) delete options.success;\n      var onerror = options.error; if (options.error) delete options.error;\n      var model = this;\n      var success = function(resp) {\n        if (!model.set(model.parse(resp), options)) return false;\n        if (onsuccess) onsuccess(model, resp);\n      };\n      var error = wrapError(onerror, model, options);\n      (this.sync || Backbone.sync)('read', this, success, error);\n      return this;\n    }\n"

I finally settled on the following; which I feel is much cleaner to maintain, and allows events to propagate through.\n\n```\nItem = Backbone.Model.extend({\n    initialize: function(){\n            this.setupAssociations({\n                    'bins': BinList,\n                    'lots': LotList,\n                    'units_of_measure': UnitsOfMeasureList,\n                    'barcodes': BarcodeList\n            });\n    },\n\n    setupAssociations:function(assoc){\n            for ( var key in assoc ) {\n                    this[ key ] = new assoc[key]( this.get( key ),{ memberOf: this } );\n                    this.bind( 'change:' + key , _.bind( this.setAssociated, this, key ) );\n            }\n    },\n    setAssociated: function(name,self,val ){\n            this[ name ].refresh( val );\n    }\n\n });\n```\n\nBy using this method, you can write code like the following and have change events flow through to the associated model/collection.\n\n```\nitem = new Item( { bins: [ { id: 1, name:'foo' ] } ) //bins will be turned into a BinsList and become a property of item\nitem.bins.get(1)  // returns 'foo'\nitem.set('bins', { id: 1, name:'bar' ] }) // fires refresh event on item.bins\nitem.bins.get(1)  // returns 'bar'\n```\n\nAny chance of getting the setupAssociations & setAssociated methods added to the Model class?  I'm not at all set on using the name associated if anyone has a better thought.\n\nAlso, if there was a way to determine which event the method was called from, it wouldn't be necessary to _.bind inside of setupAssociations.  It would be nice to have the event name passed to the handler inside backbone's trigger method.\n\nThanks for the great library!\n"

In my example I could have a table of speakers and/or a table of venues and if the collection (or a model in the collection) is modified then the relevant HTML table would be updated.\n\nI am uncertain what the convention (if any) would be if I want a HTML table (view) of conferences where each row not only contains the data from a conference model but also contains data for the venue that conference is at or for the speakers that will be attending that conference.\n\nObviously I could have my server API return the venue (or speaker) data as part of the conference data however this would not allow for a scenario where a venue is edited via its own separate view and we still want the view that lists conferences to automatically update.\n\nInstead of doing something like:\n    this.model.bind('change', this.render);\n\nI suppose the conference model could reference a venue ID and I could pass 'modelA' and 'modelB' when declaring the View and do something like:\n    this.options.modelA.bind('change', this.render);\n    this.options.modelB.bind('change', this.render);\n\nSince a view treats 'model' as a special case option I assume this isn't how things should be done.\n\nI'm also not certain how this would work in the scenario where multiple speakers will be attending a conference. The conference model could include a nested collection of speakers however the nested collection would not be updated when a speaker is updated via another view.\n\nI'm happy to model my data differently but ultimately I want to be able to have views reference models that relate to other models in some way and still have data for those sub-models be updated in the views.\n"

    "body": "Hi,\nConsider the code below. When the attributes model have more than 1 level then changing the value of some deep level attributes of the clone (or the original) will be also changed in the original (or the clone) as they share the same deep-level attribute object. A `deepClone()` function could be not simply enhancement but bug fix because browsing through the code we can suspect that the `clone()` should be replaced by the `deepClone()` in other places it is used. For instance this code:\n     this._previousAttributes = _.clone(this.attributes)\nwith the current shallow cloning results in unexpected behavior when attributes are not a single level object. If you change a deep attributes like `this.attributes.address` then `this._previousAttributes.address` points to the same object and will not report anymore the previous attributes state. Maybe you could think about a `_.extendDeep()` like in jQuery.\n\nI survey this interesting library looking for some lightweight MVC and raise some questions. Is there some forum where to exchange about Backbone and underscore?\n\nThanks for the nice job.\nJoel\n\n```\nvar bill = new Backbone.Model({\n  name: \"Bill Smith\",\n  address:{ city:\"Boston\", street:\"Some\"}\n});\n\nvar john = bill.clone();\nconsole.log(bill.attributes === john.attributes);\n// => true\n\njohn.set({name:\"John Gospel\"});\nconsole.log([bill.get(\"name\"), john.get(\"name\")]);\n// => [\"Bill Smith\", \"John Gospel\"]\nconsole.log(bill.attributes === john.attributes);\n// => false\nconsole.log(bill.attributes.address === john.attributes.address);\n// => true\n\njohn.get(\"address\")[\"city\"] = \"Paris\";\nconsole.log('EXPECTED : [\"Boston\", \"Paris\"], FOUND :',\n      [bill.get(\"address\")[\"city\"],john.get(\"address\")[\"city\"]]);\n// => EXPECTED : [\"Boston\", \"Paris\"], FOUND : [\"Paris\", \"Paris\"]\nconsole.log(bill.attributes.address === john.attributes.address);\n// => true\n```\n"

I assumed that if I do:\n    var Foo = Backbone.Model.extend({\n    // my code here\n    });\n    var foo = new Foo({test:'test1'});\n    foo.set({test: 'test2'});\n    console.log(foo.changedAttributes());\n\nI would get attribute test instead I'm getting false. I looked into source and I think the reason for this is that the 'change'  method is executed inside 'set' method (line 189) and inside change there is:\n    this._previousAttributes = _.clone(this.attributes);\nwhich overrides _previousAttributes with current ones. This basically means  that changedAttributes will always return false. I'm probably missing something here. Could you please let me know what the intension behind changedAttributes is? Thanks.\n"

    "body": "First of all, Backbone is totally awesome, thanks for all the great work! I implemented something very, very similar earlier this year but got about 75% done and had to set it aside to get a project done. I'll certainly give backbone a spin! \n\nDuring the development of my backbone-like solution, I ran into some issues that had no easy solution. I'm wondering if backbone has a way to deal with them.\n\nMy UI displays a list of projects along with members of those projects. Each project has a +/- icon that can be clicked to expand/shrink the view and show a list of full details about each member. It essentially looks like this:\n\n```\n -  Super Duper Project   Charlie (Active), Tom (Inactive)\n        Charlie Smith       Active        Seen 32 mins ago  [Deactivate]\n        Tom Jones           Inactive      Seen 2 days ago   [Activate]\n +  Boring Project        Susan (Active), Jill (Active), and 3 others\n +  Another Project       Tom (Active)\n```\n\nWhen I retrieve the project list (GET /api1/projects), I get JSON like this:\n\n```\n[{\n    id: 1,\n    name: \"Super Duper Project\",\n    members: [{\n        id: 32,\n        first: \"Charlie\",\n        active: true\n    },\n    {\n        id: 29,\n        first: \"Tom\",\n        active: false\n    }]\n},\n{ // boring project },{ // another project }\n]\n```\n\nWhen the + icon is clicked, another AJAX request is made to get each member in that project (GET /api1/projects/1/members), which returns JSON like this:\n\n```\n[{\n    id: 32,\n    first: \"Charlie\",\n    last: \"Smith\",\n    accessed: \"2010-12-05T14:30\",\n    active: true\n},\n{\n    id: 29,\n    first: \"Tom\",\n    last: \"Jones\",\n    accessed: \"2010-12-03T08:46\",\n    active: false\n}]\n```\n\nThis is totally simplified, but the point is that I have Models within Models, and I'm wondering if Backbone can somehow support this to update every instance in the view.  For instance:\n1. If I expand the Super Duper project (click the +) and then click the [Activate] button on Tom Jones, I want Backbone to Update multiple things on the screen. It should update the Tom Jones full detail row to indicate \"Active\", but it should also update the Super Duper project row to show \"Tom Jones (Active)\".\n2. I do not want to refresh the entire project list, because then the expand/collapse state of each project gets lost. The user would then have to re-expand any projects again. Also, the scroll location would be lost and the scrollable div this is in would jump back to the top.\n\nNote that I have complete control over the JSON and can change it to whatever I need. If the Project should contain an array of full Member objects instead of \"light\" versions of them, I can do that. But I also wanted to reduce bandwidth and increase speed, as my application has  LOT more data than just this.\n\nCan anyone give me advice on how to handle situations like this?\n\nThanks!\nTauren\n"

So far everything has worked out fine - thanks for that great piece of software.\n\nNonetheless we stumbled upon a problem (Maybe it's not even an issue, but I did not know where exactly to post this). We have large sets of data coming from ajax request. We use Collection.add([ ]) to get this data into the collection and we use a View (Backbone.view.extend) to ultimately render a single item out of this collection appending this item to a DOM element using an application view (just like the todo example).\n\nWhat we want to accomplish is this kind of html code:\n\n```\n<div id=\"container\">\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"check1\" /><label for=\"check1\">text</label>\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"check2\" /><label for=\"check2\">text</label>\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"check3\" /><label for=\"check3\">text</label>\n</div>\n```\n\nEvery \"<input...\" represents an item, thus a model rendered by it's view. The view class though always binds to a single element (tagName) which is created within the view. So I currently don't see any way creating something \"<input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"check1\" /><label for=\"check1\">text</label>\" using the standard backbone functionality because backbone.view would use the tagname to create a new element which can be filled with content but would always wrap around this content. So backbone.view would create something like\n\n```\n<span>\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"check1\" /><label for=\"check1\">text</label>\n</span>\n```\n\nwhen using \"span\" as the tagname.\n\nIs there a way to create this kind of html code with backbone functionality, or is it necessary to write something custom to accomplish this?\n\nThanks in advance for your work & answer.\n- Exinferis\n"

Typically, when there are multiple nested scopes, new variables will be produced called something like _results2.  In this case, that is not occurring, and two _results variables are being declared, so that the inner scope cannot reference the outer _results variable.\n\nCheck out lines 6/7 from above.  This results in push being called on an undefined variable.\n\n```\n  var _fn, _results;\n  return _results.push(function() {\n```\n\nThe problem seems to be the use of a closure inside of nested for-loops.  It doesn't have to return the closure itself to cause the problem.  This was just a short repro.\n\nIf I remove the inner function, or use a single, un-nested for-loop, then the problem goes away.  However, after playing around, I still haven't found a good workaround for using a closure when surrounded by double-nested for-loops.

    "body": "Hi, I really like the Backbone approach; simple building blocks that make creating interactive js apps easier but still leveraging the power of css/html/raw js.\n\nSo I was playing around a bit and maybe I'm understanding this wrong, but there does not seems to be an easy way to do data binding from dom properties to models. What I was trying to do is build two views tied to the same model, updating the model and expecting the views to get redrawn automatically. But is seems like I have to keep track which views are bound to which models myself, and implement updating them on model.change. That seems a lot of work for something you want to do often. See my attempt here: https://gist.github.com/714695\n\nIf all my assumptions are correct I would love to have a layer on top of the current objects that would make data bindings a lot easier. Some example psuedo-code:\n\n```\ndataBind(element, elementKeyPath, [modelKeyPath1, modelKeyPath2], \n    transformerFunction)\n```\n\nExamples:\n\n```\ndataBind(\"body\", \"css.background-color\", [preferences.color])\n\ndataBind(\"#cartView.total\", \"text\", [cart.total], \n    function(values) {return '$ ' + values.total})\n\ndataBind(\"#personView.name\", \"html\", [model.firstName, model.lastName], \n    function(values) {return values.firstName + ' ' + values.lastName})\n```\n\nI realize this is a crippled approach as it wouldn't cover:\n- two-way bindings: bind to an input field that automagically updates the model if changed\n- dependent keys: trigger the binding fullName when either firstName or lastName get updated\n- collection binding: bind a to for example the name of a selected person in a list, and even deal with multiple selections in a smart way\n\nBut just having this in there would help making simple applications a lot easier. Any thoughts?\n"

    "body": "Hi Jeremy,\n\nHere is simplified example of what I want to achieve. I want to create view only if it is needed and create root element for it only if view is instantiated. Basically I want to have my markup as clean as possible and hold all View related things in on place (all related code in its class and <i>all</i> markup in template). Sure I can create element for a view before creating instance of view but it would be interesting to have all view related things encapsulated in a View's class. \n\nAlso I don't want to have View.el be set to body in this example because I want to keep container element as narrow as possible.\n\n(This is really simplified example in real application I render template instead of creating elements on the fly)\n\n```\nTestView = Backbone.View.extend({\n    el: \"#home\",\n\n    events: {\n        \"click #test\" : \"test\"\n    },\n\n    test: function() {\n        alert(\"test\");\n    },\n\n    initialize: function() {\n        container = $(\"<div/>\").attr(\"id\", \"home\").appendTo(\"body\");\n        $(\"<a/>\").attr(\"id\", \"test\").attr(\"href\", \"#\").text(\"test\").appendTo(container);\n    }\n})\n```\n\nTo achieve this behavior it is needed to call both _ensureElement() and delegateEvents() after calling initialize method. _ensureElement could be called before initialize but in such case it will create useless element. What do you think about controlling this flow using options hash?\n\nI fully understand that moving _ensureElement call after initialize is a bad idea because current applications could rely on existence of element in initialize method, but I just want to share me experience of using Backbone and maybe give you some ideas on its gotchas in using in real environments. \n\nIn my application I've worked around this issue by having my own base class for a views that extends Backbone.View and using events hash with different name that is called and processed after calling descendant initialize method.\n"

Some folks prefer to escape once, on the way in to the database, and other folks to have their template interpolation tags escape text by default, right as the HTML is being rendered. Some pros and cons:\n- If you escape on the way in to the database, your content can never be escaped for other formats later.\n- Escaping at the template layer is notoriously inefficient ... the same piece of data may be HTML-escaped hundreds of times for a single view.\n- Using template escaping is also incorrect for (arguably) the majority of interpolations, which don't originate from user-supplied content.\n\nI think that because there's more information available with Backbone, we can do a better job here. Your user-generated data is always going to be an attribute on a Model, and we know that we're escaping for HTML, because we're in a browser... I'm proposing that we add an `escape` method to Backbone.Model, as an alternative to `get`, which instead returns the HTML-escaped value of any attribute. You could use it from a View's template like this:\n\n```\n<div class=\"account\">\n  <%= account.escape('name') %>\n</div>\n```\n\nWe could be smart about it, and lazily cache the attributes you're escaping, so that a given attribute need never be escaped more than one time, even if it's rendered in hundreds of places in the UI.\n\nThoughts?\n"

    "body": "The current (0.3.1) collection change notification architecture makes writing clean, efficient view code difficult. Collection change events can come in two different ways (add/remove vs. refresh) and each have their own drawbacks.\n\nAdd/remove could make a view with heavy per-item setup costs more efficient. However, collections may be sorted. Any view that needs to mirror the underlying collection order has to do its own indexOf lookup into the model. This leads to a potential performance bottleneck, as this lookup will be O(N) times the number of additions.\n\nRefresh is \"convenient\" from the model's perspective, but it burdens every observer with the responsibility of keeping track of model state. A refresh event basically means \"out with the old, in with the now\". This is only practical to implement if the view has some way of clearing everything, but if the view needs to know specifically which items are deleted it has to keep track of them itself.\n\nEach method has issues of its own, but my biggest gripe is that an observer MUST handle /both types/ of events to stay in sync with a collection. So I have to implement an \"add a single item\" handler, a \"remove a single item\" handler, and a \"remove each old item, then add each current item\" handler. This is two paths to implement, and two paths to test. (A view might appear to work fine in casual testing of one path, then fail when a bug in the other path is encountered.)\n\n`</rant>`\n\n`<suggestion>`\n\nI've been thinking about how to work around this in our team's current project, and how to improve the design of Backbone.js itself.\n\nFor our particular project, we see single add/remove changes being the exception rather than the common case. So we're going to try mapping all three events to a single \"refresh\" handler that blows away the current view contents and regenerates it all from the current collection state. This may result in some occasional interface flashing, but less code to maintain means a more reliable app.\n\nFor a more general solution, what if Collection exposed only two events externally: remove(arrayOfModels) and insert(arrayOfModels, prevModelOrNull, nextModelOrNull)\n\nSeems like that would allow the model to communicate efficiently with its observers (for both bulk and single updates) while observers would just have to implement two elementary operations. What does everybody else think of this idea?\n"

    "body": "(Recreating because I accidentally closed this the first time I created this...) I'm using backbone 0.3.0 with Chrome 9.0.576.0 dev with all extensions disabled on _Win 7_, and I have the following issue:\n\nI create a controller with a couple of routes, and initialize like so:\n\nnew WorkspaceController();\nBackbone.history.start();\n\nWhen I click on hashlinks that match my routing pattern, things go well. However, when I use the back button on Chrome dev, I cycle through the last 2 hashlinks instead of going backwards normally.\n\nFor example, say I have 3 links:\n(1) #game/1 (2) #game/1/quest/1 (3) #scores/game/1\n\nI click on 1, 2, then 3. This works, taking me where I need to go. I am now on #3. I click my back button, which takes me back to #2, as expected. I click back again. I would expect to go to #1, but instead I am taken back to #3. If I click back repeatedly, it cycles between #3 and #2 indefinitely on Chrome. On Firefox, the behavior is as expected (back to #2, then back to #1).\n\nAlso, when the backbutton is pressed, the forward button is not enabled. It's as if this browser thinks that the action taken by the backbutton is a fresh, \"new\" event, not truly going backwards in its history but instead adding to it.\n\nOf note, the Chrome+Win7 combo appears to be important, because the back button functionality works as expected on Chrome+XP that's running virtually.\n"

As you click through various routed links that trigger onhashchange, they work fine, but pressing back doesn't iterate back through them. Instead, it goes back to the prior page ignoring any hashchange events. Example:\n\n(0) Go to cnn.com, then go to your page that is using backbone.js. (1) Click, e.g., #job/1 (2) Click #job/2 (3) Click #job/3\n\nOnce you're on #job/3 and you press back, you'd expect to go to #job/2. Instead, on WinXP IE6 v 6.0.2600, you just get dumped back on CNN.com. Again, not sure if this is a supported browser or not, but thought I'd mention this.\n"

The call stack is:\n\nmy view's render function (this is where I end up)\nbackbone.js:92\nbackbone.js:291\nbackbone.js:168\nmy .change() function\n\nSo it seems that changing the model triggers an immediate re-rendering of the view (which is fine), but I end up with this.model being undefined, because this points to my model.\n\nI'm surely doing something wrong, but any pointers appreciated.\n"

    "body": "Hi!\n\nWhile I like the idea to use models as a namespace, you sometimes will want to integrate against an existing JSON API that either uses another key, or a plain array. It would be nice to have the ability to somehow specify this with a property/function in the collection you're creating, e.g by declaring a responseKey property/function which is used to determine where in the response the model data is (much like the current url-property).\n\nThe only current solution is to monkey-patch the fetch-method (specifically the success-callback) itself, which isn't very pretty.\n\nExample:\n\nvar c = Backbone.Collection.extend({\n  // ...\n  responseKey: \"data\"\n  // ...\n});\n\nvar c2 = Backbone.Collection.extend({\n  responseKey: function(response){ return response; } // if it's just an array.\n  // you could also go deeper, eg response.data.documents\n});\n\nShould be a very simple fix to implement, so what do you guys think?\n"

In `DocumentView` the example class doesn't implement a `template` attribute with a `render` method.\n\nI made a couple assumptions and hacked together a working solution.\nhttps://gist.github.com/1ac113d3cc2fef9fbe99\n\nI created a `TaskTemplate` object literal with the variable `html` storing the ERB-style Underscore template. The `render` method receives attributes from the model and this particular template renders using Underscore's `_.template` method.\n\nIs this similar to the the pattern that DocumentCloud uses?\n\nAlso, does all of your HTML exist inside of JS files or are they pulled from partials via Ruby?\n\nWith this pattern the HTML delivered to the browser would contain no markup for a task. Instead, it would delivery JSON or a JavaScript object which would render each element when the add event is triggered.\n\nYou mention bootstrapping the page in the docs. I'm wondering if that refers to rendering markup or generating JavaScript and delivering the model data with the HTML in a `<script>` tag or similar.\n\nIs there a way to bind an element which pre-exists on the DOM? In an existing project, not using Backbone (yet), I render all the markup for existing objects and manipulate the model and corresponding views via event triggers.\n\nWould be happy to publish a full sample app, once I get some clarity on \"best-practice\" patterns you've developed around this great library.\n"
