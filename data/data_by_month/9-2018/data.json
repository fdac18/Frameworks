considerations", "body": "given considering rewrite event system thinking attaching events react root thought would fitting explore options mount event listeners little combine knowledge scattered across repo general three candidates attaching event listeners document listeners react root listeners element listeners every option comes shortcomings want summarize learned years document listeners historically react always listened document level implemented synthetic event system simulate capture bubble phases inside react tree event listeners listening bubble phase means users still add capturelevel document listeners see fire react process event additionally events bubble dom support bubbling events react sometimes eagerly adds event listeners media events example listens capture phase instead usually works leave react event system attach native listeners needed certain caveats come one example calling capture documentlevel listener effect another implication interoperability react roots thirdparty frameworks behave unexpectedly browsers certain optimizations place make handling document listeners complicated safari properly bubbling document listeners used chrome respect preventdefault touch start document level also never cleaning documentlevel listeners certain benefits solution well current event system use event bus implement polyfills require document based listeners implementation portalbubbling easier need ensure already listening document portal target later react root listeners one solution issues outlined use react roots mount target events would still rely event delegation would require synthetic event system root level listeners would certainly help make bubbling robust using multiple react instances since longer add listeners level however work bubbling events use capturing would fire inverse bubble order capture handlers multiple roots also always fire wrong order portal bubbling also become complicated since find portal root inside reactroot see need attach listeners portal root well consider following example need add listeners well compare example need compiled list previous implementation attempts issues pointed well date pr issues oct enterleave shims using instance react events like focus firefox fire reverse order tap highlight shims jun firefox mousemove events aug enterleave shims probably possible work around someall issues invalid capturing order worked around adding bubble capture listener regular events trigger appropriate phase shims probably rewritten need document additional listeners could added ios tap highlight could disabled via css get rid edge cases around events bubble browser consider deprecating support together new features since taking time rethink event system also want us think passive event listeners web components think albeit additional implementation effort support passive event systems keep using event delegation add two different listeners one capturing one bubbling handle completely different events support shadow roots bit complex event delegation really make sense easily consider shadow root react root portal root since rely adding listeners parent shadow root consider following case html handy comparison custom elements support different javascript framework react definitely better planned changes event system work element listeners sort radical approach changing event system get rid event delegation altogether happens preact reactdomlite vuejs probably frameworks well research ember angular point case trivial add support passive event listeners bubblecapture behave expected also allows us completely remove need synthetic event system could rely browser also know browsers better optimize certain events attached directly element think least two major roadblocks though performance event delegation avoids need every element event handler figure significant overhead really especially considering possible bundle size improvement make initialrender faster needs compared realworld application rough benchmarking microbenchmark outcomes representative real apps eventsystem less react noticed another feature event delegation often overlooked setstate batching right react knows event listeners called batch setstate calls case looked bit potential callback mechanism would fire events processed next frame drawn think possible browsers evaluate performance implications realworld application see bad often setstate batching occurring could still batch inside event listener portal bubbling big issue see portal bubbling still need use event delegation portal roots catch events listened parents writeup react fire gaearon mentioned could use redispatching native events would still require us set listeners first considerations whole synthetic event system currently accounts react dom bundle size back july worked example removed everything event related added tiny preactlike system find much save look edge cases much already got tests pass general might also consider adding api installing global dom event handlers since upcoming concurrent mode make complicated listen arbitrary non reactcontrolled

gets thorny dom properties attributes js dom attributes properties attributes things usually see html properties things usually set js crucially dom apis exist setting properties setting attributes even always setting thing many cases nt matter cases maybe way one might think using react one abstraction react setting properties common misconception since react currently uses convention dom props means react setting dom properties wrong fact react currently using attributes almost props supports cases like causing issues discussed want revert cases actually great nt include list supported

allowing attribute name property names let consistent use attribute names go using attribute names could plausible bump first consideration brought using react component feel like idiomatic javascript often components forward least props underlying dom element js renders would awkward custom accept props inconsistent capitalization forces consumer always remember certain prop actual dom prop part

domrelated props follow camelcase convention dom property names often end component apis want component apis consistently camelcase want make easy custom components like wrap forward without either translating attribute name point flow dom without introducing noncamelcase props custom component api also explains props like custom attributes reasonable exceptions even though could make richer apis rarely passed custom components typically coupled dom useful custom components instead become implementation detail something like richer camelcase api react properties already nt match dom properties dom property name convention nt work need something else could camelcase version attribute name seems like almost always already checks sounds radical consider already support something called dom property name dom property called dom property already deviating dom property names nt match camelcase javascript convention brings us finally vs part original justification making react setting dom properties name dom property however explained react nt use properties anymore except three four special case importantly react nt even consistently use dom property names rather uses

javascripty another argument early code like nt valid relevant nt write anymore either using toolchain like babel likely targeting react nt even support inconvenience left ca nt write think time
