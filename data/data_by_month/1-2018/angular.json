suggest marketing ca nt compete vuejs since uses javascript typings accessibility super easy everyone coming javascript maybe even like jquery nt lot knowledge still make things possible angular hand hard learn oop regular jsdeveloper even harder total beginner opinion worth communicated also would aim real developers even may even got touch web development finally typescript makes possible c swift c python java developer jump straight web development thanks typescript build real software types interfaces classes generics etc etc top angular gives us perfect framework building complex web applications simple even web applications extend electron nativescript ionic constraints opinion communicated angular great big ass applications would focus marketing technology architecture maintainable even people working years people say use vuejs childish things comes grownup stuff use angular anyway know angular reducing bundle size lot angular libraries elements way release gets interesting little projects would still aim huge projects also little space see whats coming going people may think going mars next year uh thats awesome wonder going next years easy update semantic versioning also promoted nice updating felt like minor update detailed informations website one important thing would promote unbelievable progress angular showing graph bundle size angular angular graph going little bit future saying aim something one example happened project since impressive please show world documentation accessibility documentation great way nt get wrong also frustrating sometimes could teach stuff quarter time compared someone reading comes vuejs positive thing hear documentation critic points documentation really longsome written tutorial style think one router thing cant look scroll big tutorial search search search missing stuff read full documentation thinking know everything still sometimes internet come across stuff never heard eg ngclass documentated short classclasstoadd probably cant something googling something term angular gives angularjs results mostly search angular kind outdated try mostly results suggestions tutorial called something like quickstart get angular minutes fundamentals techniques reworked something called tutorial cover every little detail instead could give quick overview every feature like adding one simple animation get know animations working practically example project like tour heroes add links everywhere documentation dive deep topics something like less informations little aspect add new menu item documentation actual documentation giving us everything point click routing see everything related router routing navigation maybe add section best practices usage service dumpsmart components organize stuff etc keep api actual documentation could wiki everyone suggest updates something explained simple something missing take look vuejs documentation communication community mentioned issues already highly requested things like elements creating library easily runtime translations etc currently ask updates ask often long time answer goes within long issue comments suggest need place angulario see going team working new features high priority much effort put xy ideas future estimations xy important community impressed angular listen every little detail know awesome stuff coming bet community know also frustrating hear something awesome like elements hearing nothing ages decisions new users framework use project may take year time huge stuff happening within angular knows whats going see

previous discussion method used upgrade dom element angular custom element afaict initial reasoning able support environments natively support custom elements using polyfills instead would result much better uniform experience could hide public api keep implementation case turns useful support using component angular templates exporting custom element app solution previously agreed lack better alternative prefix selectors custom elements define angular component selector custom element registered selector background previous discussion issue atm angular component registered custom element using inside angular template causes instantiated twice angular compiler browser recognizes custom element calls essentially way tell whether element part angular view therefore treated custom element example want publish angular components custom elements part uses inside template ideal solution currently possible able detect inside least something inside angular view eg angular component template nothing ie instantiate component instance possible workarounds use different selectors eg inside angular templates used custom element option could add new optional property decorator eg would default value property useful intention use component custom element inside angular templates page option could automatically prefix selectors predefined configurable prefix registering custom elements eg would default registered configurable prefix added benefit essentially namespaces components makes easier avoid conflicts different custom element libraries although might moot point since already recommended prefix components custom prefix option annotation would tell compiler element ce way renderer could create element marker would inhibit ce facade anything mhevery said way think renderer put expando dom elements way elements facade wakes check presence expando short circuit expando would cost dom creation think easiest thing different prefixsuffix elements gkalpak said since ce constructor called angular instantiates component could set special property ce constructor angular could check ignore element compatible aot mhevery said nt think something could since would mean angular apps would penalized check regardless using think solution onus check ce suppressed rather angular component think ce needs able detect angular component active become noop sure best way without penalizing everyone one idea change renderer put expand elements dash issue checking dash present monkey patching free especially check element maybe check would done compile time runtime

definition concept scope angular js tricky mature market trend recruit new developers local issue course yet applicable however suffered tremendously harness angular power benefits soon start deviating angular opinionated everything literally encounter tons problems examples want create applications per month similar business context deeper concept ioc field configuration preparation creates business value instead developer project controlling configuration preparation tend configure prepare bigger context spl example angularjs would ask developer create simple folder create html js files features application immediately based convention without extra step yet angular soon create new project tens configuration preparation files created packagejson packagelockjson tsconfigjson tslintjson karmaconfjs polyfillts easily deviate files across projects expensive sense spl example need one projectjson file somehow inherited across projects one polyfillts file even repeated across projects developers wo nt see need use filesystem architecture different angular architecture folder naming folder nesting component naming similar things nt want load entire module rather need load component separately navigate another route need load route component fly lazily nt want create module per component load modules lazily nt want use typescript firstcitizen scripting language bloated
