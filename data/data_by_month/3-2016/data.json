six months codenamed glimmer started fork htmlbars almost every line code rewritten sometimes several times distilled learnings building previousgeneration rendering pipelines handlebars htmlbars original glimmer project etc resulting architecture simultaneously fitting ember use cases also flexible wellpositioned future extensions nonember use cases find codez written typescript think pretty cool anyway emberconf integration still lot work mostly optimizations would like engine believe implemented enough cover basic ember use cases two months ago started integrating new engine ember proper follow metaissue progress sofar yet possible use new engine real apps yet expect work completed relatively soon expectation finished implementation relatively painless dropin upgrade apps like original handlebars htmlbars migration noted ability toggle feature flag probably land existing features implemented probably work seamless app getgo pls send halp might wondering help glad asked boom sparkles fireworks tada point highest value help help port existing tests help reviewing prs see ember pretty extensive test suite tests view layer behavior problem lot tests written ways quite coupled existing implementation otherwise uses legacy semantics longer supported order certain cause regressions would like able run entire test suite current rendering engine htmlbars glimmer written new test harness allow us get technical details basic idea written test cases abstraction layer encapsulates differences two engines allowing code test cases run implementations along way also modernizing existing tests process rely legacy semantics unless appear explicitly testing semantics case leave alone new test harness also makes much easier much pleasant matrix style tests highlevel architecture diagram net result tests much easier read reason also greatly increased coverage great outcome everybody still lot tests left feel confident shipping engine without ported however could help us port test file good shape time next week harness works actual mechanism used pretty low tech might heard called symbolic links inside test folder package find file called abstracttestcasejs also symlinked location inside package file defines apis use write test cases file shared symlinked packages contain anything specific two implementations instead differences abstracted importing files provided package alternatively package also override specific methods abstract classes see emberglimmer vs emberhtmlbars versions lot cases might even need modify files knowing workswhere work happen underthehood might still helpful run issues tests work since engine intended dropin upgrade real apps long tests actually testing features supposed used real world reason tests would nt run engines focus far see example test physically located inside directory symlinked location directory fact entire directory symlinked see test imports packagespecific otherwise agnostic rendering engine implementation process general highlevel process looks like pick test file port usually existing test file somewhere make new file inside somewhere port test casemodule new file using new class format ensuring test go inur cycle initial render noop rerender update via mutation reset via replacement cycle removing ignoring duplicated tests tests implicitly covered update cycle mentioned symlink test back package unless parent folder already symlink like concat test showed remove old file unless still contains tests ported open pullrequest make easy review add line comment test case removed stating rationale eg ported covered via duplication also feel free add commentsquestions tests sure write good tests general tipsrules follow improve test cases inur cycle would like test go inur cycle initial render render template want test initial values choice assert result expect example noop rerender call without changes values assert result remain example update via mutation make updates values use templates example try break updates multiple chunks ie multiple assertion makes sense increase chances catching clobbering bugs updating values blow away another unrelated part template causes undesirable effects use interior mutations makes sense value string primitive value nt matter dealing object array means updating values inside objectarray keeping objectarray array example object example try different forms interior mutations makes sense one ways eg vs removing item etc usually good idea try one example reset via replacement reset original starting condition replacing variables reset helps catch bugs caches original value text node forgot update cache along way case change anything original value would work fine change back original value shortcircuit dom code nothing replacement values simple primitive values like strings nt make difference values objectsarrays etc means replacing objectarray another new object opposed mutating internal values array example object example avoid duplicating tests easy copy test case times test slightly different variations thing eg starting true vs false difference pojo vs done lot existing tests sometimes best lot problems first produces large amount tests physically file making hard find things also someone need add new test usually randomly pick one variants carrying detailsmistakes nt make lot sense new scenario fix bugs one copies probably forget rest usually ways avoid duplication example case testing different starting condition test starting conditions test else f else f follow usual inur cycle cases able define shared behaviors extracting shared super classes putting actual test cases super class configure parts different subclass allows write test cases automatically run many different scenarios matrix style tests best example probably conditionals test etc actual test file simply defines template invocation style subclass located sharedconditionaltestsjs automatically get many shared tests inline ifunless tests takes even running set test cases different invocation scenarios actual structure sharing somewhat difficult arrive took time matureget right payoff massive basic scenarios shared well legacy semantics lot existing tests uses legacy semantics like views controllers etc times purely incidental result test written time primitives main way things cases usually port new harness uses components instead without problems doubt also test unported first iteration pr ask questions line comment decided default using tests uses curly components almost rather rely relying attrs reflected onto property name ie unless test specifically testing probably file generally prefer rather consistency always name things like vs feel need disambiguate see also locks caveats sometimes tests ported might work either glimmer htmlbars nt work either engine probably something wrong case nt work glimmer probably nt implemented feature completely yet example implemented basic components support nt implemented point case still good port test new style simply enable feature implemented disable test temporarily glimmer simply replace prefix method name means run htmlbarsonly also disable entire module prefixing name rare cases test work correctly glimmer pass htmlbars double check semantics testing correct also quite possible simply bug current implementation htmlbars usually happens test htmlbars features new matrix style values update correctly edge cases case similarly flag individual test case entire module since expected quite rare might require bug fix would helpful include brief description problems encounter line comment examples great examples community members helped port existing tests inline helper inline helper see earlier iterations
