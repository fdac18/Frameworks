used sw find new app version note sw may serve different app versions different app instances eg different tabs sw guarantees app instance continue receive files correspond assigned version important user app open tab deploy new version updated asset might incompatible old app version eg new js script expects new layout breaks used old one nt want user suddenly start getting new incompatible asset still using old therefore important sw able tell asset file belongs specific version reliable way discussed far comparing content btw also browsers detecting modified serviceworker scripts example imagine deploy version includes asset sw detects new version starts downloading assets version meantime deploy version modified sw requests cache version receive new backwards incompatible version deployed server happily cache serve version rest app files version app would broken essentially sw needs able tell whether received file actually one belongs current version updating also lazily
