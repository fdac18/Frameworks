instantiating components router speak called preactivation activation nt unit tested without guards resolvers components involved tested isolation router actually run execute navigation testing talked two types tests comment test integration tests allow us test everything test navigations unit tests router navigations nt code units example say module looks like tested fashion integration tests

integration tests testing router navigations phrase integration tests extremely overused see comment define mean actually call side spectrum isolated tests might opinion use testbed common test components fashion even though personally fairly common test services resolvers guards like common use case think good idea option write unit tests without using routertestingmodule one limitation keep mind routerstate tree activated routes create tree components corresponding tree activated routes without actually performing router navigation testbed describes one injector need tree injectors time want test several components using activated routes time resort integration test means unit test single component activated route options thought reusing routertestingmodule unit tests find difficult two reasons say something like testbedconfiguretestbed declarations componenta componentb imports routertestingmodulewithroutesinaunittestfashion child need provision url actually navigate anywhere place pass params path component componenta children path child component componentb const testbedcreatecomponent componenta nt actually create componentb const b testbedcreatecomponent componentb gets activated route componenta mentioned without actually navigating create single activated route confusing moment router configuration children think clearer providing single activatedroute like testbedconfiguretestbed declarations componenta componentb imports routermodule imports directive providers provide activatedroute usevalue createactivatedroute child path children path child const testbedcreatecomponent componenta createactivatedroute clearly test helper creating activated route object assumption somehow instantiate componentb pass right activated route componentb also test helper make schema permissive instance nt need pass components componentb nt even provisioned course like testbedconfiguretestbed declarations componenta imports routertestingmodulewithactivatedroute child path children path child const testbedcreatecomponent componenta thought find one thing problematic since routertestingmodule built integration tests creates real router means component calls router try navigate means router configuration must support target url makes harder test components isolation summary hard reuse routertestingmodule unit
