direct dom manipulations cases prefer using components main codereuse abstraction directives longer instances means inside directive hooks receives everything arguments note object immutable setting

unbind el binding vnode use destructuring care value addition hook changes longer gets called automatically always gets calls component rerendered regardless whether value bound changed compare skip unnecessary updates also cases want always apply updates eg directive bound object might mutated instead replaced directive params directive options etc deprecated filter usage syntax change vue several changes filter system filters used inside text interpolations tags past found using filters directives etc led complexity convenience list filtering appropriate move logic javascript computed properties vue ship builtin filters recommended use standalone libraries dedicated solving problems specific domain eg momentjs formatting dates accountingjs formatting financial currencies also

asset type global method option deprecated configure transition inline component props events create reusable transition effects especially custom javascript hooks well answer creating transition components particularly suitable functional components use like html toggled content vmodel changes params modifiers new modifier trims input name suggests param deprecated see upgrade tip bottom

works used iterated primitive value nt work equivalent javascript see setting another value iterator function nothing local variable function scope instead use array objects update field object props

declaring prop set component due new rendering mechanism whenever parent component rerenders child component local changes overwritten general treat props immutable use cases mutating prop replaced either data property computed property keepalive longer special attribute wrapper component similar makes possible use multiple conditional children note children eventually evaluate single child child first one ignored used together make sure nest inside slots longer supported duplicate name template slot rendered used rendered elsewhere render tree content inserted via named longer preserves

hand designed primarily programmatic access javascript recommended rely templates entails referring state belong instance misc replaced follows rule binding attribute without prefix treated literal string cases want use dynamic binding expects full expression instead string key example html interpolation inside attributes deprecated html attribute binding behavior change considered falsy binding attributes means empty strings render asis enumerated attributes means render also enumerated attributes addition falsy values string value false also render attr false used custom component listens
