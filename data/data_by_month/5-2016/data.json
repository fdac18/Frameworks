limitations nested loops bonus two fewer points syntax newcomers learn new array syntax switched order arguments consistent javascript new object syntax switched order arguments partly consistent many common object iterators lodash index available object iteration visual purposes table striping directive interface change general directives greatly reduced scope responsibility used applying lowlevel direct dom manipulations cases prefer using components main codereuse abstraction directives longer instances means inside directive hooks receives everything arguments note object immutable setting effect properties added persisted persist directive state absolutely need html js example directive export default bind el binding vnode binding object exposes value oldvalue expression arg modifiers bindingexpression ab bindingarg arg bindingmodifiers modifier true context vue instance accessed vnodecontext update changes see update el binding vnode oldvnode componentupdated new hook called entire component completed current update cycle means dom would updated state hook called also hook always called regardless whether directive value changed componentupdated el binding vnode oldvnode unbind el binding vnode use destructuring care value addition hook changes longer gets called automatically always gets calls component rerendered regardless whether value bound changed compare skip unnecessary updates also cases want always apply updates eg directive bound object might mutated instead replaced directive params directive options etc deprecated filter usage syntax change vue several changes filter system filters used inside text interpolations tags past found using filters directives etc led complexity convenience list filtering appropriate move logic javascript computed properties vue ship builtin filters recommended use standalone libraries dedicated solving problems specific domain eg momentjs formatting dates accountingjs formatting financial currencies also welcome create filter pack share community filter syntax changed inline javascript function invocation instead taking spacedelimited arguments transition system transition css class changes alwayson

gives ability specify different easing curves enterleave transitions cases upgrading means simply replacing current css animations use transition api change component singleelement transition effects applied wrapping target elementcomponent builtin component abstract component means render extra dom element show inspected component hierarchy simply applies transition behavior wrapped content inside simplest usage example html toggled content component defines number props events maps directly old transition definition options props name string used automatically generate transition css class names eg auto expand etc defaults appear boolean whether apply transition initial render defaults css boolean whether apply css transition classes defaults set trigger javascript hooks registered via component events type string specify type transition events wait determine transition end timing available values default automatically detect type longer duration mode string controls

transition css classes example applying transition dynamic components events corresponds javascript hooks available api beforeenter enter afterenter beforeleave leave afterleave beforeappear appear

cancelled however still available transitions similar hooks presence second argument indicates user wants explicit control ending timing transition component multielement transition effects applied wrapping elements builtin component exposes props events difference unlike renders real dom element default renders configure element render via prop also use attribute eg support prop every child must uniquely keyed example moving transitions supports moving transitions via css transform child position screen changed updated get applied moving css class auto generated prop configured prop css property transitionable moving class applied element smoothly animated destination using flip technique see live demo creating reusable transitions transitions applied via components longer considered asset type global method option deprecated configure transition inline component props events create reusable transition effects especially custom javascript hooks well answer creating transition components particularly suitable functional components use like html toggled content vmodel changes params modifiers new modifier trims input name suggests param deprecated see upgrade tip bottom longer cares initial inline always treat vue instance data source truth means following render value instead goes existing content instead main idea js side considered source truth templates longer works used iterated primitive value nt work equivalent javascript see setting another value iterator function nothing local variable function scope instead use array objects update field object props behavior deprecated props always oneway produce side effects parent scope component needs explicitly emit event instead relying implicit binding mutating prop locally considered antipattern eg declaring prop set component due new rendering mechanism whenever parent component rerenders child component local changes overwritten general treat props immutable use cases mutating prop replaced either data property computed property keepalive longer special attribute wrapper component similar makes possible use multiple conditional children note children eventually evaluate single child child first one ignored used together make sure nest inside slots longer supported duplicate name template slot rendered used rendered elsewhere render tree content inserted via named longer preserves attribute use wrapper element style advanced use cases modify inserted content programmatically using render functions refs longer directive special attribute similar html dynamic ref bindings also supported merged used normal element ref dom element used component ref component instance longer reactive registeredupdated render process making reactive would require duplicate renders every change hand designed primarily programmatic access javascript recommended rely templates entails referring state belong instance misc replaced follows rule binding attribute without prefix treated literal string cases want use dynamic binding expects full expression instead string key example html interpolation inside attributes deprecated html attribute binding behavior change considered falsy binding attributes means empty strings render asis enumerated attributes means render also enumerated attributes addition falsy values string value false also render attr false used custom component listens custom events emitted component longer listens dom events longer works use negation expression one time bindings deprecated use instead arrayprototype set remove deprecated use vueset arrayprototypesplice instead longer supports inline root instance longer use template props use instead option longer used used instance creation option work vue instances mandatory properly declare toplevel reactive properties option also prohibited replace component instance root prevents edge cases reactivity system makes component state predictable especially typechecking systems user watchers created via fired associated component rerenders gives user chance update state component rerender thus avoiding unnecessary updates example watch component prop update component data prop changes something dom component updates use updated lifecycle hook upgrade tips deal deprecation reason deprecating event flows depend components tree structure hard reason components tree becomes
