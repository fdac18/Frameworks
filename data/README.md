# Framework Data
- This is where all of the data collected on each framework will be sorted, by source.

# Comprehensive list of Prominent Frameworks
- [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular/)
- [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue)
- [Backbone](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone)
- [Ember](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js)

Technically speaking, React and jQuery aren't frameworks, but because they are _essentially_ considered one and their popularity over the years has been astounding, it would be a disservice to not include both.
