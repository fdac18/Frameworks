    "recommendation": "Update to version 0.12.7 or later.\n\nAs this vulnerability is primarily a user error, the patch for the vulnerability will simply cause the application to write an error message to the console when a vulnerable configuration is used in a production environment.\n\nWriting a proper CORS configuration is still the responsibility of the user, so it is necessary to check for the error message after installing the patch. Be sure you are not using `allRoutes: true` with `origin:'*'`, and that you uncomment `origin` and set it to a reasonable value. Ensure that if `origin` is set to `*` that you truly mean for all other websites to be able to make cross-domain requests to your API.\n\nLikewise, ensure `credentials` is uncommented out and set to the appropriate value.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to send a specific series of of messages to a listening peer and get it to reveal internal memory.\n\n\nThere are two mitigating factors here, that slightly reduce the impact of this vulnerability:\n\n1. Any modern kernel will zero out new memory pages before handing them off to a process. This means that only memory previously used and deallocated by the node process can be leaked.\n1. Node.js manages Buffers by creating a few large internal SlowBuffers, and slicing them up into smaller Buffers which are made accessible in JS. They are not stored on V8's heap, because garbage collection would interfere. The result is that only memory that has been previously allocated as a Buffer can be leaked.",

The vulnerability allows an attacker to guess the password for the admin service, no matter how complex that password is, in less than 200 requests.\n\n\n## Details\nThe tomato API has an admin service that is enabled by setting up an `access_key` in the config options. This `access_key` is intended to protect the API admin from unauthorized access.\n\n\nTomato verifies the `access_key` by checking to see if the server `access_key` incorporates the user provided value at any location. This allows an attacker to provide a single character as an `access_key`, and so long as the server key contains at least one instance of that character it will be considered a valid key.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nThis is the snippet of code that does the comparison to authorize requests.\n\n```\nif (access_key && config.master.api.access_key.indexOf(access_key) !== -1) {\n```\n\nFor an access_key that is set to anything that includes the letter 'a' the following request would be authorized.\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST \"http://localhost:8081/api/exec\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d @test -H \"access-key: a\"\n{\n \"cmd\": \"ls\",\n \"path\": \".\",\n \"stdout\": \"app.js\\nconfig.js\\nlog\\nnode_modules\\nserver.js\\n\",\n \"stderr\": \"\"\n}\n```\n",
